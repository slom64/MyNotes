Great questions — you’re thinking in the right direction. I’ll clear up the differences and show why **NTLM relay is usually more valuable than just stealing hashes**. I’ll cover: (1) why the attacker needs to be “in the middle”, (2) what relaying _actually_ achieves (vs. collecting hashes), (3) how it’s used in real attacks, and (4) short note on defenses.

# 1) Why “man-in-the-middle” (MitM) is required

NTLM relay depends on capturing a _live_ authentication exchange (the challenge–response messages) between a client and a server. To get those messages the attacker must cause the client to talk to an attacker-controlled endpoint — or trick the client into connecting to the attacker. That’s why the attacker places themselves between the client and the service (or impersonates the service):
- The client initiates NTLM negotiation expecting to authenticate to a legitimate service.
- The attacker answers and _relays_ the client’s responses to another, chosen target service.
- Without being in the middle (or posing as the endpoint), the attacker can’t intercept the live challenge/response.

So “in the middle” is simply how the attacker _gets the authentication data in real time_ and then forwards it.

# 2) Relay vs. just stealing hashes — what relaying actually gives you

This is key: **relay is not the same as “steal a hash and crack it”**. They are different techniques with different outcomes.
### Stealing hashes (and cracking)
- Attacker obtains stored password hashes (or captured NTLM hashes) and then tries to crack them offline to recover the plaintext password.
- That takes time, CPU, wordlists, GPU, and may fail for strong passwords.
- If cracked, attacker can reuse the password to log in anywhere that accepts it — but cracking is the bottleneck

### NTLM relay (no cracking needed)

- The attacker _does not need to recover the password or the hash_.
- Instead, the attacker **reuses the victim’s live authentication exchange** and authenticates as the victim to some target service right away.
- That means **instant access** to services the victim can access — without waiting, without offline cracking.
- The attacker can act with the victim’s privileges immediately (read shares, make LDAP changes, request certificates, etc.).

**So the big advantage of relay:** _immediate, actionable authentication as the victim — often to high-value services — without ever cracking anything._

---
# 3) Concrete examples of what relaying achieves (real impact)

Here are realistic attack goals that go well beyond “collecting hashes”:
- **Access SMB file shares** as the victim — read/modify files, steal secrets, plant persistence.
- **Perform LDAP binds / modify directory objects** (if the victim has privileges) — change group membership, add accounts, etc.
- **Abuse web endpoints that accept NTLM** (IIS, Exchange, internal web apps) to perform actions as that user.
- **Exploit AD CS enrollment endpoints**: relay can be used to request certificates for the victim (certificate issuance as the victim), which enables further impersonation or Kerberos impersonation—this is high-impact and can lead to domain compromise.
- **Execute operations that trigger privileged actions** (e.g., manage services, connect to databases, access admin portals) — depends on what the victim's privileges allow.
- **Lateral movement**: authenticate to other hosts/services, move from one machine to another without credentials being cracked.

All of those are _immediate_ — no expensive cracking step. In many environments, obtaining a single interactive authentication from an unprivileged but domain-joined user is enough to reach high-value targets via relaying.

# 4) How relay compares to other techniques (PTC/Pass-the-Hash etc.)
- **Pass-the-hash (PtH):** attacker obtains a hash and presents that hash to authenticate to services directly. It requires possession of the hash (stolen from disk or memory). 
- **NTLM relay:** attacker does not take or reuse the hash directly — they forward the live negotiate/challenge/authenticate messages from the victim to the target.
- **Cracking hashes:** offline, time-consuming, may fail. Relay bypasses cracking entirely.
Each has pros/cons, but relay’s immediacy and lack of requirement to extract keys/hashes from a host make it powerful.

---
# 5) Practical constraints — when relay works and when it doesn’t
Relay is powerful but not universal. It succeeds when:
- The target service accepts NTLM authentication (and the account’s auth can be applied there). 
- Protections that prevent relaying are absent or misconfigured:
    - **SMB signing** not required → SMB relays work.
    - **Channel binding / Extended Protection** not enforced on HTTP → HTTP relays work.
    - Target endpoints accept NTLM and don’t validate server identity
- The attacker can coerce the client to authenticate (LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning, malicious link, injected content, etc.

Relay fails or is harder when:
- Services require Kerberos-only or mutually authenticated TLS.
- SMB signing/channel binding is enforced.
- Network segmentation prevents the attacker from reaching the intended target.

---
# 6) Why attackers prefer relay in many AD attacks
- **Speed:** immediate access without cracking.
- **Stealth:** no noisy password-guessing or cracking traffic; leveraging normal auth flows looks more normal on the network.
- **Privilege escalation vectors:** can target high-value services (e.g., certificate services, LDAP) to escalate privileges quickly.
- **No need to fully compromise a machine** to use captured authentication — just coerce a user’s client to talk to you.    
---
# 7) Quick ASCII flow to visualize a relay (client → attacker → target)

Client -> (connect to what it thinks is Service A) -> Attacker (acts as Service A)  
Attacker -> (forwards auth to actual Service B) -> Target Service B  
If Target accepts, Attacker now authenticated to B as the Client.

So the attacker is simultaneously acting as a fake server to the client and a fake client to the target.

---

# 8) Short defender checklist (so you can relate attack to defense)

- Require **SMB signing** / require channel binding.    
- Disable NTLM where possible; prefer Kerberos.
- Enforce **Extended Protection for Authentication** on IIS/HTTP.
- Harden name resolution (disable LLMNR, NetBIOS; use secure DNS).
- Limit which machines/services accept NTLM; segment networks.
- Monitor for unusual NTLM authentications and access patterns.

If you want, next I can:
- Show a **detailed packet-level walkthrough** of the NTLM messages in a relay scenario (where the challenge and response go), or
- Explain **coercion techniques** (how attackers make a client connect to them — LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning, malicious links, HTML tricks), or
- Give a **lab plan** to safely practice relaying in an isolated AD environment.
