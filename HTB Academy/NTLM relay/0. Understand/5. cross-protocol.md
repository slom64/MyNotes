> ahhh i see, instead of relay the same protocol from client to server. we change the protocol so the protocol between client and attacker is http then we can change the protocol between the attacker and server to be LDAP or anything. the main idea is to use different headers and things but the main response payload that validate the user is sill the same

Exactly — nailed it. ✅
Short confirmation and a few useful extras so you can think like an attacker _and_ a defender.

## TL;DR (you already got it)

- The **NTLM payload (NTLMSSP blobs)** — the Negotiate / Challenge / Authenticate pieces — are what prove identity and are reusable across application protocols because they’re just embedded data.
- The attacker **changes only the outer protocol framing** (HTTP headers vs LDAP bind packets vs TDS for MSSQL) but forwards the NTLM blobs so the Authenticate always matches the Challenge the target issued.
- So client↔attacker can be HTTP while attacker↔target can be LDAP/MSSQL/SMB — the NTLM part remains the same.
## A few important practical caveats you should be aware of

1. **Negotiate flags & feature compatibility:** The client’s Negotiate blob contains flags (capabilities). The target might require certain flags (signing, sealing, NTLMv2, etc.). Relay tools usually forward or adapt these, but incompatibilities can break relays.
2. **Channel binding / Extended Protection:** Some services bind the NTLM auth to the TLS channel (or require extra server identity checks). That prevents naive cross-protocol reuse because the authenticate is tied to the original channel properties.
3. **Protocol framing differences:** You’re not translating HTTP requests into LDAP queries. You only transplant the NTLM blobs into LDAP’s bind flow — after authentication you then speak LDAP (search, read). ntlmrelayx and similar tools handle this framing automatically.
4. **Session keys and post-auth context:** Once you successfully authenticate to the target, the attacker gets the session context for the attacker→target connection (session keys, cookies, etc.) and can act independently of the victim from that point — until the session expires or protections intervene.
5. **Defender signals:** The target will see the user logging in from the attacker’s IP. Good monitoring (unusual source IPs, odd services being accessed) helps detect this. Also hardened configs (Kerberos-only, SMB signing, TLS channel binding) stop many cross-protocol relays.

> [!question] 1st question
> What is cross-protocol in NTLM authentication attacks

Great question — this is a point where people often get confused. Short answer first: **“Cross-protocol” relay means you take the NTLM _authentication messages_ captured from one application-layer protocol (e.g. HTTP) and replay/embed those exact NTLM messages into a _different_ application-layer protocol’s NTLM handshake (e.g. LDAP, MSSQL, SMB).** Because NTLM is just an authentication _sub-protocol_ that many different application protocols embed, you can move (relay) the authentication across protocols — then, once authenticated to the new service, you speak _that_ service’s protocol (LDAP queries, SQL commands, SMB file ops, …) as the victim.

Now a clearer, step-by-step conceptual breakdown and the important caveats.

## What “cross-protocol” relay actually is

1. Many app protocols (HTTP Negotiate/NTLM, SMB, LDAP simple/bind with NTLM, IMAP, MSSQL/TDS, RPC, SMTP, etc.) use NTLM _inside_ their protocol to authenticate a client. The NTLM part is usually the same challenge/response exchange, just wrapped differently at the application layer.
2. In a normal relay you capture an NTLM Authenticate from a victim speaking one protocol and forward it to the _same_ protocol on the target.  
    In **cross-protocol** relay you capture the NTLM messages from _protocol A_ (e.g., HTTP) and inject them into the NTLM handshake for _protocol B_ (e.g., LDAP) toward the target.
3. If the target service B accepts NTLM and the authentication is valid for the account, the attacker establishes an authenticated session on _protocol B_ (LDAP, MSSQL, etc.). At that point the attacker can issue protocol-B actions (LDAP search/dump, SQL queries, SMB file ops) as the victim — even though the victim originally attempted to authenticate to a different service.
## Why this works (the core reason)

- NTLM is protocol-agnostic in the sense that the challenge/response machinery and the derived session key are the same across protocols. The application protocol just packages NTLM messages. So the raw NTLM Authenticate message from a victim can often be embedded into another protocol’s Authenticate step and accepted by the target if:
    - target accepts NTLM, and
    - the authentication context (domain, username, NTLM version) matches what the target expects.
## Concrete (conceptual) flow — HTTP → LDAP example
1. Victim browses an attacker page (or is poisoned) and does an HTTP NTLM auth to the attacker.
2. Attacker extracts the NTLM Negotiate/Challenge/Authenticate messages from that HTTP exchange.
3. Attacker opens an LDAP bind to the domain controller (or LDAP server) and uses those extracted NTLM messages as the LDAP NTLM bind: i.e., sends the victim’s Authenticate inside LDAP’s bind operation.
4. If the DC accepts the NTLM auth for that account, the attacker now has an authenticated LDAP session as the victim and can run LDAP queries (dump users, read attributes) using LDAP protocol calls.

## Why you don’t “relay the whole protocol” — only the NTLM auth
Important: you are **not** magically translating HTTP requests into LDAP queries. You are only transplanting the **NTLM auth messages** from one protocol handshake into another. After the transplant, you (the attacker) open your _own_ connection to the target using protocol B and act as the authenticated client on that protocol. The application-level actions are entirely those of protocol B (LDAP queries, MSSQL queries, SMB operations).

# Why some protocol pairs are allowed and others not (the table)
- The table in your module lists which _source_ protocol’s NTLM auths can be embedded into which _target_ protocols. It reflects:
    - **Compatibility**: Whether those protocols accept NTLM messages in a format you can inject. Many do.
    - **Practical constraints**: Some protocols bind NTLM to TLS channel data, use channel binding or extended protection, or otherwise tie the NTLM handshake to particular context that prevents cross-protocol reuse. Those protections make some pairs ineffective.
- Example why HTTP→HTTP might be listed “No”: if the server expects additional TLS/channel binding that prevents naive replay back into HTTP, or because relaying HTTP to the same type can be trivially detected or blocked by implementation details. (Different implementations and versions behave differently; the table is a practical compatibility chart.)
- In general, cross-protocol works whenever the target will accept the raw NTLM authenticate in its own authentication flow and no extra channel binding prevents reuse.
# Practical implications & constraints (defender/attacker view)
- **Target must accept NTLM**: If the target forces Kerberos-only, relay fails.
- **Signing / Sealing / Channel binding**: If target requires channel binding/extended protection or enforces SMB signing etc., cross-protocol relays often fail or are mitigated.
- **Principal/account privileges**: The victim account’s privileges determine what you can do once authenticated. For AD escalation, targeting services like LDAP/AD CS/MSSQL that can be abused is valuable
- **SPNs and required auth flavors**: Some services demand certain NTLM flags or SPN behavior; certain source→target combos may not meet those requirements.
- **Auditing & detection**: The target will see a login that looks like the user authenticating from the attacker’s host — useful for defenders to detect.

# Example: HTTP NTLM capture → MSSQL target (module excerpt)
- The victim tries to authenticate to HTTP (coerced).
- ntlmrelayx captures the NTLM messages and relays them to MSSQL (via mssql:// target). If accepted, the attacker now has an MSSQL authenticated session as that user and can use mssqlclient to run queries against the DB using that identity. The -socks flag helps chaining other tools through the relayed session.

## TL;DR — keep this in mind
- Cross-protocol relay = take captured NTLM auth from protocol A and use it inside protocol B’s NTLM handshake.
- Success depends on the target accepting NTLM and not having protections that bind authentication to the original channel (channel binding, forced signing, Kerberos-only).
- Once authenticated to the _target protocol_, you act as that authenticated user inside protocol B (LDAP queries, SQL commands, SMB operations), even though the victim originally spoke protocol A.

> [!question] 
> the only thing that i can't get it is that every NTLM authentication has 3 different messages negotation/challenge/response, as what i understand from what you have said. we use the same response in another NTLM authentication, but why is this valid the other NTLM authentication will have different challenge so by using the same response as the first authentication will result wrong answer

Great question — you spotted the exact wrinkle that makes honest relay work _not_ just “copy-paste a response”. The short answer: **a relay doesn’t reuse an old Authenticate message — it forwards the live Challenge from the target to the client and forwards the client’s matching Authenticate back**. In other words, the attacker acts as a transparent middleman for the NTLM handshake so the response always matches the challenge the target just issued.

---
## Key idea (one sentence)

In a real relay the attacker performs two simultaneous NTLM handshakes and **forwards the target’s Challenge to the victim**, so the victim computes a response that is valid for the target’s Challenge — not some previously-captured one.

## End-to-end flow (who sends what)

1. Client → Attacker: **Negotiate** (client says “I want to NTLM”)
2. Attacker → Target: **Negotiate** (attacker forwards or issues its own negotiate to target)
3. Target → Attacker: **Challenge_T** (target replies with its random nonce/challenge)
4. Attacker → Client: **Challenge_T** (attacker forwards the target’s challenge to the client)
5. Client → Attacker: **Authenticate (Response_T)** — client computes response using Challenge_T and its secret
6. Attacker → Target: **Authenticate (Response_T)** (attacker forwards the client’s authenticate to the target)
7. Target validates Response_T against Challenge_T and accepts — session established between Attacker and Target as if Attacker were the client.
That’s the whole trick: the attacker _does not_ try to reuse an old Authenticate; they forward the target’s challenge to the victim so the victim produces the correct response for _that_ challenge.
## Why cross-protocol still works
NTLM’s challenge/response math is the same across many application protocols. The attacker only needs to extract the raw NTLM blobs from protocol A’s exchange and inject them into protocol B’s NTLM handshake at the right times. The attacker replaces framing/headers as needed but keeps the NTLM payloads untouched — especially forwarding the target’s Challenge to the victim so the response lines up.

## Why a stale/captured Authenticate typically fails
If you just recorded a client’s Authenticate for some previous Challenge_old and tried to replay it to a target that sent a different Challenge_new, the target would compute its own expected response for Challenge_new and the old Authenticate would not match → authentication fails. That’s why live forwarding of the target’s Challenge is essential.

## Practical notes / gotchas
- Relay tools (e.g., `ntlmrelayx`) automate this bidirectional forwarding for you. They listen for client NTLM auth attempts, open a connection to the chosen target, and shunt the Challenge/Authenticate blobs back and forth in real time.
- This requires the attacker be able to _relay in real time_ — the victim must be tricked/coerced into authenticating while the relay is active.
- Protections such as SMB signing, channel binding (extended protection), or Kerberos-only policies break or complicate this because they bind the auth to particular channel properties or require per-message cryptographic proofs the attacker can’t synthesize.
## TL;DR

You don’t reuse an Authenticate from the past — you forward the target’s fresh Challenge to the victim, the victim generates the response to that fresh Challenge, and you forward the response back to the target. That’s how the response is valid on the other NTLM handshake.
