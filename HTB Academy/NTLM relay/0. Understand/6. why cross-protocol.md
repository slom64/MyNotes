Great question — this is the strategic bit: **cross-protocol relaying isn't done for novelty — it gives attackers practical advantages that same-protocol relays often don't.** I'll summarize the main reasons, give short examples, and show when a same-protocol relay might still be preferred.

## Why change the protocol (what advantages you get)
1. **Access higher-value services**
    - Many high-value actions (dump AD, enroll certs, run SQL queries, change LDAP objects) are exposed over specific protocols (LDAP, MS-SQL, AD-CS HTTP endpoints). If you can only coerce HTTP auth from a user, relaying that NTLM into LDAP or MSSQL gives you access to those powerful capabilities.
    - Example: HTTP → LDAP relay allows you to run LDAP queries on a Domain Controller as the victim — far more impactful than being authenticated to the original HTTP site.
2. **Victim coercion is easier on some protocols (entry vs target mismatch)**
    - It’s often much easier to _get_ a victim to authenticate over HTTP (malicious webpage, iframe, embedded resource) or via name-resolution poisoning (LLMNR/NetBIOS) than to get them to talk directly to an LDAP or MSSQL service. So you capture NTLM from an easy vector and reuse it against a valuable service that the victim would never intentionally reach.
3. **Bypass service-specific protections / misconfigurations**
    - Some services (or their admin configs) require mutual auth, channel binding, or Kerberos-only for their _own_ incoming connections, but other services on the network accept NTLM more permissively. Cross-protocol lets attackers target the _weaker_ service that actually performs the sensitive operation.
    - Conversely, some same-protocol relays are blocked by protocol-level defenses (e.g., SMB signing required on many hosts), but the same account may still be able to authenticate via another protocol that lacks enforcement.
4. **Broader attack surface / chaining options**
    - Different protocols expose different functionality. By enabling cross-protocol, the attacker can pick the most powerful protocol available for follow-on abuse (LDAP for AD traversal, MSSQL for DB dumps and execution, AD-CS for certificate issuance). It’s about chaining: capture (easy) → relay (powerful) → abuse (impactful).
5. **Firewalling and network reachability**
    - An attacker’s host may be able to reach certain target ports/services that the victim cannot, or vice versa. By changing protocols, an attacker can exploit pathways that a straight client→server relay wouldn’t reach. Also, internal firewall rules may permit LDAP from certain subnets but block SMB, making cross-protocol preferable.
6. **Practical tooling and automation**
    - Tools like ntlmrelayx support many target protocols and provide helpers (SOCKS proxies, protocol adapters). That makes it operationally convenient to grab NTLM from one place and immediately use it wherever you want.
7. **Avoiding user/client protections**
    - Some clients will refuse to perform certain protocol handshakes or will enforce TLS/channel binding for some services but not for ordinary HTTP requests. Capturing NTLM via the more permissive client behavior and relaying it into a vulnerable backend works around these client checks.
## When same-protocol relays are used / are fine
- If the victim already authenticated to the exact same protocol you want to abuse (e.g., they opened a network share), a same-protocol relay can be simpler and faster.
- Same-protocol is also used when the target protocol _is_ the valuable service (SMB share access, RPC services) and there is no reason to switch.
## Concrete short examples to make it click
- Victim loads a webpage (HTTP). You capture NTLM. You relay to LDAP on the DC → now you can `ldapsearch` and dump users & hashes or query group memberships. That gives escalation paths (find admins, target them).
- Victim mistypes `\\server\share` → LLMNR/SMB capture would be natural, but SMB signing blocks relay. However, you can still coerce an HTTP auth from some user and relay into MSSQL (which accepts NTLM) to exfiltrate data.
- Victim authenticates to an internal printer’s web UI (HTTP) — attacker relays that NTLM to AD-CS enrollment endpoint and requests a certificate for that user → later abuse via Kerberos.

## Short decision heuristic (attacker mindset)
- Capture where it’s easiest (often HTTP or poisoned SMB/LLMNR).
- Relay where it’s most valuable (LDAP, MSSQL, AD-CS, SMB on privileged hosts).
- If same-protocol relay is blocked or low value, try cross-protocol — it vastly increases the number of useful targets.
