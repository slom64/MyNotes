> ok what do we mean by message signing and sealing in NTLM. like this protocol is for authentication not for securing messages like RSA. so what message is being signed or sealed and how is that happens

Perfect timing üôÇ ‚Äî you‚Äôre noticing an important subtlety: NTLM isn‚Äôt just a **login protocol**, it can also provide **session security services** (message signing and sealing) after authentication. Let‚Äôs go step by step.

---

## 1) NTLM is both authentication **and** session security

- The handshake (Negotiate ‚Üí Challenge ‚Üí Authenticate) authenticates the user.
- As part of this handshake, both client and server derive a **session key** (from the password hash + challenge/response exchange).
- That key can then be used not only to _prove who you are_ but also to **protect further messages** exchanged between client and server.

So NTLM defines optional features: **message signing** and **message sealing**.

---

## 2) What is **signing** in NTLM?

- **Signing** = ensuring **integrity**: proving a message hasn‚Äôt been tampered with.
- After the handshake, every protocol message (e.g., SMB file read/write request, RPC call) can include a **Message Integrity Code (MIC)**.
- The MIC is a cryptographic checksum (HMAC-MD5 in NTLMv2) computed using the **session key** and the message contents.
- When the server/client receives a message, it recomputes the checksum using the same session key and compares.
- If the values differ ‚Üí message was modified ‚Üí reject.

üëâ Example:  
Attacker relaying NTLM to SMB cannot just modify SMB packets if **SMB signing** is required, because each SMB request/response is signed using the session key. The attacker doesn‚Äôt know the key (only the client and server do), so they can‚Äôt forge signatures.

---

## 3) What is **sealing** in NTLM?

- **Sealing** = ensuring **confidentiality**: encrypting messages.
- Uses the same session key derived during authentication.
- In NTLMv2, sealing is done with RC4 (stream cipher) keyed with the session key.
- All subsequent protocol messages (SMB requests, RPC calls) are encrypted (‚Äúsealed‚Äù), so only the client and server can read them.

üëâ Example:  
If sealing is negotiated in SMB, an attacker sitting in the middle cannot see the file contents transferred because they‚Äôre encrypted with the NTLM session key.

---

## 4) Where do signing and sealing happen?

NTLM itself doesn‚Äôt send application data. But other protocols (SMB, RPC, HTTP, etc.) **wrap their messages in NTLM‚Äôs signing/sealing layer** if both sides agree to it.

- In **SMB**: ‚ÄúSMB signing‚Äù uses the NTLM session key to sign each SMB packet.
- In **RPC**: NTLM can provide ‚Äúintegrity‚Äù and ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù for DCE/RPC messages.
- In **HTTP**: usually NTLM just authenticates, then the app sets a cookie and relies on TLS for confidentiality; sealing is less common here.

---

## 5) Why does this matter for relay?

- If a service requires **signing** (e.g., SMB signing required), an attacker can‚Äôt successfully relay authentication because they can‚Äôt sign further SMB messages without knowing the session key.
- That‚Äôs why defenders often mitigate NTLM relay by enforcing signing (SMB signing, LDAP signing, etc.) or channel binding.
- If signing/sealing aren‚Äôt required ‚Üí attacker can still use the relayed authentication to issue valid, unsigned requests.

---

## 6) Analogy to make it stick

Think of NTLM like a club entrance system:

- The **handshake** is showing your ID (proving who you are).
- The **session key** is a secret handshake you agree on after being admitted.
- **Signing** = stamping every message you pass with that handshake ‚Äî proving you wrote it and it wasn‚Äôt altered.
- **Sealing** = putting your messages in a locked box with that handshake as the key ‚Äî so outsiders can‚Äôt read them.

---

‚úÖ TL;DR

- **Signing** = message integrity using the NTLM session key.
- **Sealing** = message confidentiality (encryption) using the NTLM session key.
- These happen **after authentication**, for all subsequent protocol messages, and are what block relays if enforced.

> [!question]
> hmmm cool, that mean i can't do really if signing or sealing is enabled because attacker can't know the session key "it doesn't get transmitted in the wire". now signing is all about getting  the hash of the  content of the message + session key, that give us hash, if the signing is not enabled that mean we can get the hash by just passing content of message if we wanat. For sealing, if signing is enabled does that mean sealing is enabled too? and for sealing i don't think we can do anything if it is enabled because attacker will see all the messages as random characters

Nice ‚Äî you‚Äôre thinking exactly the right questions. I‚Äôll tighten up and correct a few small misunderstandings and then answer both of your sub-questions clearly:

1. **Does signing give the attacker a ‚Äúhash of the content‚Äù they can reuse?**
2. **If signing is enabled, is sealing automatically enabled?**
3. **What can the attacker do when signing/sealing are enabled vs disabled?**
---

## Quick summary first

- **Signing** = message integrity (a MAC/HMAC computed over the message using the _session key_).
- **Sealing** = confidentiality (message encryption using the _session key_).
- Both use a _session key_ that is established as part of the NTLM handshake. The attacker **cannot** compute a valid signature or decrypt sealed messages unless they can derive that session key for the connection they are using.
- **Signing and sealing are negotiated separately** ‚Äî one can be on without the other (though many implementations support both).

Now the details.

---
## 1) Signing: what exactly is signed, and can the attacker compute it?

- **What is signed?** Protocol-level messages that follow authentication (for example, SMB packets or DCE/RPC messages). Each message is accompanied by a small integrity token (a MAC), usually computed over:    
    - the message bytes (or selected fields), and
    - a sequence number and/or other context, and
    - the **session key** derived during the NTLM auth.  
        In NTLMv2/extended security this MAC is based on HMAC (HMAC-MD5 historically) using the session key.
- **Can the attacker get that ‚Äúhash‚Äù from the wire and reuse it?** No. The MAC value you see on the wire is specific to:
    - the exact message contents, and
    - the sequence number, and
    - the session key.  
        If the attacker replays the same signed message later, the recipient may detect replay (sequence numbers) or the signature will not match if any content changed. And crucially **without the session key the attacker cannot compute new valid MACs** for arbitrary messages. Simply observing a MAC on the wire doesn‚Äôt let you forge valid MACs for new messages.
- **Why this blocks many relays:** If a target requires message signing for the protocol (e.g., SMB signing is required), then after the NTLM handshake the server expects future protocol messages to include correct MACs computed with the session key. An attacker who only relayed the initial authenticate but cannot compute MACs will be unable to send valid signed requests ‚Äî so the attack fails (or becomes much harder).
---
## 2) Sealing: what it does and whether it‚Äôs tied to signing

- **Sealing = encryption.** After the handshake a stream cipher (historically RC4 in NTLMv2 implementations) can be used to encrypt subsequent messages using keys derived from the session key. That prevents eavesdroppers from reading payloads.
- **Is sealing automatic if signing is enabled?** No ‚Äî **signing and sealing are separate negotiation flags** in the NTLM/SMB/etc. negotiate step. A server/client pair may choose:
    - signing only (integrity but plaintext),
    - sealing only (confidentiality without integrity ‚Äî rare), or
    - both signing + sealing.  
        In practice many servers offer both, but you cannot assume one implies the other.
- **Effect on the attacker:** If sealing is enabled and enforced, an attacker who is not able to derive the session key cannot decrypt the exchanged data ‚Äî they‚Äôll just see ciphertext. If they _do_ manage to complete an authenticated session on their own connection to the target and hence have the session key for that connection, they can decrypt the traffic on their connection. But they cannot decrypt a victim‚Äôs original protected traffic on a different connection unless they share the same session key (they usually won‚Äôt).
---
## 3) Important nuance about relays and session keys (practical consequence)

This is where people often get confused ‚Äî there are two separate connections to think about:
- **Victim ‚Üî Attacker (attacker impersonating service).** The victim believes it authenticated to the attacker. That connection has its own handshake and (if signing/sealing were negotiated) its own session key between _victim and attacker_.
- **Attacker ‚Üî Target (attacker impersonating client).** The attacker uses the relayed authenticate to talk to the target and establishes _another_ NTLM handshake and thus a session key between _attacker and target_.

Because the attacker is an endpoint on the Attacker‚ÜîTarget connection, **if the Target accepted the Authenticate, the attacker will have whatever session context the Target assigns for that connection** (including any server-side session state). That means:

- If the Target requires signed messages and the attacker, acting as client, can compute the session key for **their** connection to the target, they can produce MACs and continue the session.
- If the Target requires signing but it‚Äôs derived in such a way the attacker _cannot_ compute it from relayed data (server-side protections like channel binding, extended protection, or sequence nonces), then the attacker will be unable to produce valid MACs and the relay will fail.

The practical result: **enforcing signing/sealing (and channel binding/extended protection) on the target connection is one of the most effective mitigations** against NTLM relay. If those protections are in place and correctly configured, simply relaying the Authenticate usually won't give the attacker a usable session.

---
## 4) Concrete examples (short)

- **SMB with signing required:** Attacker relays Authenticate ‚Üí target accepts only if attacker can produce valid SMB signatures thereafter. If the attacker can‚Äôt produce signatures (no session key), commands will be rejected ‚Üí relay blocked.
- **HTTP NTLM without channel binding:** Attacker relays Authenticate to a web app; the app issues a session cookie ‚Äî attacker can use that cookie on their connection ‚Üí immediate access. (Web apps frequently rely on HTTP cookies or app sessions after NTLM success, which is why HTTP relays are common if protections are weak.)
- **Sealing on SMB:** If sealing is negotiated, files transferred are encrypted at the SMB layer. An attacker on a different connection who lacks the session key cannot read those file contents.
---

## 5) TL;DR / short answers to your lines:

- ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do really if signing or sealing is enabled because attacker can't know the session key.‚Äù ‚Äî **Correct in spirit.** If protections are properly enforced so the attacker cannot derive the needed keys for the connection, signing/sealing stop the relay from being useful.
- ‚ÄúSigning is all about getting the hash of the content of the message + session key ‚Äî that give us hash, if signing is not enabled that mean we can get the hash by just passing content of message if we want.‚Äù ‚Äî **Not exactly.** Signing uses a keyed MAC (message + session key). Without the session key you cannot compute valid MACs. Observing prior MACs on the wire does not let you compute new ones. If signing is disabled, the attacker can forge or alter messages because there is no integrity check; but you don't ‚Äúget the hash‚Äù for later reuse ‚Äî you simply have an unsigned protocol where the server won‚Äôt check integrity.
- ‚ÄúFor sealing i don't think we can do anything if it is enabled because attacker will see all the messages as random characters.‚Äù ‚Äî **Correct:** sealing encrypts the payload; without the session key you see ciphertext only.
---

If you want to go deeper I can:

- Show a **diagram** of two separate connections (victim‚Üîattacker and attacker‚Üîtarget) with where signing/sealing/session keys live; or
- Walk through the **NTLMv2 session key derivation** steps (more cryptographic, and I can cite the exact formulas), or
- Explain **channel binding / extended protection** (how binding NTLM to TLS prevents relays of HTTP NTLM).

Which next step would help you most?
