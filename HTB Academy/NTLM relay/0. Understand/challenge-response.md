## 1. The core problem

When you log in, the server needs to **verify you know your password**.  
But sending the password in plaintext is dangerous (someone could sniff it).

So instead of sending the password, protocols like NTLM use a **challenge–response mechanism**.

---
## 2. The idea

- The server sends a **random challenge** (a number/nonce).
- The client computes a **response** using:
    - The challenge, and
    - A value derived from the password (like a hash).
- The server can compute the expected response (since it also knows the hash of your password from its database).
- If the client’s response matches, the server knows the client must know the password — **without the password being sent**.

## 3. NTLM challenge–response (simplified)

1. **Negotiate**: Client → Server    
    > "I’d like to authenticate using NTLM."
2. **Challenge**: Server → Client
    > Sends a random number (the challenge).
3. **Authenticate**: Client → Server
    - Takes the challenge.
    - Encrypts it with a key derived from the user’s password hash.
    - Sends the encrypted value = **response**.
4. **Verify**: Server
    - Uses the stored password hash of that user.
    - Performs the same computation on the challenge.
    - If the values match → authentication succeeds.

## 4. Analogy (easy mental model)

Imagine:
- The **server** says: “I’m thinking of a random number, prove you know the secret key by transforming this number correctly.”
- The **client**: applies the secret formula (based on their password hash) and sends the result.
- The **server**: applies the same secret formula and checks.
- If the results match, the server is convinced you know the secret — but the secret itself was never revealed.

## 5. Weakness that enables **relay**

- The client doesn’t check _who_ it is talking to (in NTLM, server identity verification is weak).
- So if an attacker sits in the middle:
    - They can take the challenge from a _real_ server.
    - Forward it to the victim client.
    - Forward the client’s response back.
    - The real server accepts it → attacker logs in as the victim.
That’s the essence of NTLM relay.

👉 Do you want me to also draw a **step-by-step NTLM handshake diagram** (with arrows: client ↔ attacker ↔ server) so you can visualize where the challenge–response is intercepted and relayed?
