Nice — your mental model is already correct. I’ll fill in the missing pieces and show exactly what happens after the server accepts the NTLM **Authenticate** message, and whether the attacker can keep talking to the service as the authenticated user without the client.

I’ll cover three things:

1. What the server does immediately after a successful NTLM authenticate,
2. How the authenticated “session” is represented (session key, cookies, connection state), and
3. What that means for the attacker (how long they can act as the user and what constraints exist).

---

## 1) Right after the server accepts the Authenticate message

When the server checks the client’s response and it matches what it expects, the server concludes: _“this side (the client) proved knowledge of the account’s secret”_. From there the server typically:

- **Marks the authentication as successful** and associates it with the connection/interaction.
- **Derives a session key** (for NTLM this is a cryptographic key computed from the challenge, the client response, and the stored password hash). That session key is used by the server and client for later integrity (signing) and sometimes confidentiality (sealing) of further messages in that protocol.
- **Optionally issues application-level state** (for HTTP it might set a session cookie or JWT, for an SMB server it keeps an authenticated SMB session object tied to a connection).
- **Authorizes** what the authenticated identity can do (checks group membership, ACLs, etc) and then services accept requests under that identity.

So the handshake doesn’t just “verify once and forget”; it establishes the authentication context the server will use for subsequent requests.

---

## 2) How that authentication context is represented (protocol differences)

### A — For connection-oriented services (SMB, RPC, many Windows native services)
- NTLM is **connection-bound**: the server and client establish a session for that TCP connection.    
- The **session key** produced from the handshake is used to sign subsequent protocol messages (SMB signing) so both sides can verify messages haven’t been tampered with.
- The server keeps an internal session tied to that connection (socket). As long as that connection/session remains open and valid, the authenticated client can make further calls.

**Implication for an attacker:** if the attacker successfully authenticates to the SMB service by relaying, they now own an authenticated SMB session on their side and can issue SMB commands as the victim — no need to keep the original victim’s connection open _to the attacker_, because the attacker created their _own_ connection to the target and authenticated on it using the relayed exchange. The attacker just needs to keep that authenticated connection open.

### B — For HTTP/HTTPS services using NTLM

- HTTP NTLM uses a multi-step handshake over the HTTP connection (Negotiate → Challenge → Authenticate).
- After a successful NTLM authenticate, an HTTP server often issues **application-level session state**, e.g. a cookie or JWT, so subsequent HTTP requests can skip repeating the heavy NTLM handshake. That cookie is typically valid until it times out or the server invalidates it.
- Whether that cookie is usable by the attacker depends on how the server ties authentication to the connection and any channel binding in place. If the server accepts the cookie and it isn’t tied to the original client-side channel, the attacker can reuse it.

**Implication for an attacker:** once the attacker completes NTLM on their own connection to the HTTP server they can often reuse the session cookie or simply continue on that connection. The attacker does not need the victim to keep sending anything after the initial relay is used to authenticate.

### C — TLS and channel binding

- Some servers bind authentication to the TLS channel (channel binding / extended protection). That links the NTLM auth to the specific TLS session (or server identity). This defeats naive relays because the attacker can’t present the same channel binding on their side unless they control the same TLS session.
- If channel binding is enforced, a captured Authenticate may not be usable from a different connection.
---

## 3) Does the relay “end” after the Authenticate, and can the attacker act independently?

Short answer: **Usually yes — the attacker can continue without the victim once they’ve established their own authenticated session to the target.** But details depend on the protocol and protections.

- **If the attacker completed authentication on their own connection to the target**, they now have an authenticated session on that connection and can act as the user until that session expires or is closed. The victim is no longer needed for further actions. That’s the common relay model: attacker pretends to be server to victim, relays handshake to target, authenticates to target, then uses target access directly.
- **If the server issues an application session token (cookie)** after auth and it’s not bound to the original client connection, the attacker can reuse that token for subsequent requests.
- **If the protocol requires per-message proof (signing) and the attacker has the session key** (as in SMB), the attacker can sign messages and continue using the service.
- **If channel binding or mutual authentication is required**, the attacker may not be able to continue (the server may require proofs tied to the original TLS channel or server identity). In those cases the relay can fail to become persistent.

So the relay does not have to be a one-time thing — it commonly leads to a fully usable authenticated session for the attacker.

---

## 4) Example scenarios to make this concrete

- **SMB relay**: Attacker relays NTLM to the SMB target and establishes an SMB session. They can now list/overwrite files, create shares, run RPCs allowed to that account — all over the attacker’s SMB connection. The victim isn’t needed after the relay completes.    
- **HTTP NTLM relay**: Attacker completes NTLM on their connection to an internal web app. The web app returns a session cookie. The attacker uses that cookie to perform actions as the victim (e.g., change settings, access data). Again, victim not needed after auth.
- **AD CS (certificate enrollment) relay**: Attacker authenticates to the CA web enrollment endpoint as the victim, then requests a certificate for that identity. With that certificate the attacker can impersonate the user in Kerberos or other flows — a powerful escalation that proceeds after the initial relay.
---

## 5) Practical constraints / limitations attackers face

- **Session lifetime** — server sessions/cookies expire or can be revoked. The attacker’s window may be limited.
- **Network restrictions** — attacker must be able to reach the target service.
- **Protections** — SMB signing, channel binding, TLS mutual auth, Kerberos-only policies, or server-side checks can block or reduce relay success.
- **Some servers log authentication and may trigger alerts** — good monitoring can detect suspicious NTLM authentications.
---

## 6) TL;DR (brief)

- After the server accepts the NTLM Authenticate, it creates an authentication context (session key, connection/session state, possibly an app cookie).    
- The attacker who completed the Authenticate on their own connection **does not generally need the victim after that** — they can continue talking to the server as the victim for as long as that session is valid.
- Whether the attacker can freely reuse the session depends on the service (SMB vs HTTP vs custom), and on protections like channel binding and signing.
---

If you want, I can next:

- Draw a **diagram** showing attacker ↔ victim ↔ target and where the authenticated session gets created, or
- Walk through **packet-level NTLM fields** (what exactly is used to derive the session key), or
- Show a **concrete SMB vs HTTP example** with the exact post-auth behavior.
Which of those would be most helpful?
