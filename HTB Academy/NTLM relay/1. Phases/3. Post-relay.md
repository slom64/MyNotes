There are numerous post-relay attacks that we will cover in this module. The following comprehensive mindmap by [@_nwodtuhs](https://twitter.com/_nwodtuhs) showcases all three phases of the [NTLM relay attack](https://www.thehacker.recipes/ad/movement/ntlm/relay):

|**Component**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|
|`Coercion Method`|These techniques induce/coerce the client into performing authentication, including `AiTM` and `authentication coercion` (which we will discuss later).|
|`Incoming NTLM auth over`|These are the protocols that the client uses to perform `NTLM` authentication, including `HTTP` ( `1`) and `SMB` ( `2`).|
|`Client-side mitigation`|These are the client-side mitigations that clients can have to protect against `NTLM` relay attacks, depending on the protocol specified in the `Incoming NTLM auth over` component.|
|`Server-side mitigation`|These are the server-side mitigations that servers can have to protect against `NTLM` relay attacks, depending on the protocol specified in the `Incoming NTLM auth over` component.|
|`Relayed NTLM auth over`|These are the protocols that we can relay the `NTLM` authentication received from the client over, including `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `SMB`, `LDAP`, and `LDAPs`.|
|`Post-relay attack`|These are the post-relay attacks that we can carry out depending on the protocol of the `Relayed NTLM auth over` component. However, reaching this component depends on the two circles belonging to the `Client-side mitigation` and `Server-side mitigation` components. If both are green, the relay attack will work. However, if one is yellow, the relay attack will only work if the server suffers certain vulnerabilities.|
