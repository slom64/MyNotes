# Farming Hashes

We have learned how to abuse the default setting in Windows when the DNS server cannot respond to a DNS request and use `Responder` to intercept and poison that request and grant us a Man-In-The-Middle position. However, if this functionality is disabled on the network or no users perform these actions, we can use other functionality in Windows that would allow us to force authentication directly to our computer.

This is about how to force users to do NTLM authentication to us.

By default, on a Windows OS, when a user visits a folder, it automatically attempts to display the filesâ€™ icons. We can abuse this functionality by placing a file with the icon location pointing to a remote location [UNC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/file-path-formats#unc-paths) path `\\172.16.117.30\fake.ico` (our attack host), forcing force the user that opened this folder to authenticate to the specified UNC, trying to display the contents of the icon.
