 When we talk about `mutual authentication` we're refering to the two sides of authentication:
1. The service authenticates the client
2. The client authenticates the service

The first side of authentication happens with the `AP-REQ` request.

The second side of authentication happens with the `AP-REP`, if the flag `mutual-required` was set in the `AP-REQ` message sent by the client.
