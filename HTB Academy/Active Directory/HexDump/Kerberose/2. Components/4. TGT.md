A `Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)` is a Kerberos ticket that is used to issue `Service Tickets' through a `Key Distribution Center' (KDC).

In secure deployments of Kerberos, the `TGT` is issued after proper authenticaton with the `Authentication Server (AS)`. If the authentication is successful, the `KDC` will issue a `TGT`.

> [!NOTE]
> If the `TGT` is issued before authentication, an attack known  as `AS-REP Roasting` can be performed on the Kerberos realm.

The `TGT` contains various information, such as:
  - User ID
  - TGS ID
  - Expiration Time
  - TGS Session Key
  - Ticket Flags
  - More...

> [!NOTE]
> The `TGT` is not sent in clear, but it is encrypted with the `KDC` secret key. This is used for authentication purposes.

- `leo @ HEXDUMP.LAB` the name of the principal (UPN).
- `krbtgt/HEXDUMP.LAB @ HEXDUMP.LAB` the server that generated the ticket, since this is kerberos, it means that this ticket is a TGT.
- `initial` flag that specifies this is the first ticket.
- `pre_authent` flag that specifies authentication occured to obtain the ticket.
- `AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96` encryption methods to protect the ticket.
