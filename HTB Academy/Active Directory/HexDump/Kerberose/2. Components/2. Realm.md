A `Kerberos Realm` defines a logical security boundary that contains group of principals (users, services and computers) that trust a specific 
`Key Distribution Center (KDC)` for authentication purposes.

In Active Directory, a realm is automatically created when a domain is initialized. 
The Kerberos Realm is the uppercase version of the AD domain name.

---

To discover the realm your user is currently is, execute the following command, which print the `User Principal Name` (UPN)

```batch
klist
whami /upn
```

For example, for the domain `hexdump.lab`, the kerberos realm will be `HEXDUMP.LAB`.
