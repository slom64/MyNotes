It is the core component of Kerberos that deals with initial authentication and with the issuing of tickets.

# It is made up of two specific services:
## Authentication Server

(AS)Component that deals with initial authentication.
After verifying the user identity, it generates a *Ticket Granting Ticket* (TGT). These tickets can then be exchanged for *Service Tickets*.

## Ticket Granting Server (TGS)

Component responsible for issuing *Service Tickets* by using the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).
The *Service Tickets* allow users to access server resources.
