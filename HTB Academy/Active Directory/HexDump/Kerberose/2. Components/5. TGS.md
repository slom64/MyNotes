A `Service Ticket`, also known as `Ticket Granting Service (TGS)` is a Kerberos ticket that allows an authenticated user to access a specific service or resource by using a previously obtained TGT.

It is issued by the KDC, and specifically by the Ticket Granting Server. Once you obtain a ST, you can present it to the target service. The ticket is created in such a way so that only the service can decrypt it with its own secret key and it is used to validate the identity of the user.

If the ST is valid, the user will be allowed to access the resource without entering the passwords.

  Example of an ST obtained with `klist`

```

  - `leo @ HEXDUMP.LAB` is the name of the principal (UPN)
  - `LDAP/DC01.hexdump.lab/hexdump.lab @ HEXDUMP.LAB` name of the server, since this is `LDAP` it means that this is a TGS.
