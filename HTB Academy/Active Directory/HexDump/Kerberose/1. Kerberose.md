 Kerberos is an `authentication key agreement' protocol.

This means that Kerberos allows two entities to establish a `shared secret key` securely, starting from an insecure communication
channel.

Notice that this is also what happens in the web. In the web however,when using HTTPs, we have the TLS protocol, which works by using `X.509 digital certificates` to authenticate entities (and a lot of other things), which is implemented using 
`public-key cryptography`.

In kerberos entities are not authenticated by digital certificates. Instead, entities can rely on a centralized server,
which is the `KDC` (Key Distribution Center), that knows a long-term secret key for each entity involved in the communication. 
By using such knowledge, it is possible to establish `ephemeral session keys` that allow clients to authenticate to services.

  Kerberos is built on top of the `Needham-Schroeder Symmetric Key Protocol'.
