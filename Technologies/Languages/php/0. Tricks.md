- In PHP 8 and later, the `0 == "Example string"` comparison evaluates to `false` because strings are no longer implicitly converted to `0` during comparisons. The behavior when comparing an alphanumeric string that starts with a number remains the same in PHP 8. As such, `5 == "5 of something"` is still treated as `5 == 5`.
