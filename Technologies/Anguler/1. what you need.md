# constructor

## javascript
In javascript there is predefined functions that exists in every variable or functions.
```js
funtion test()
{
	console.log('hello world');
}
test(); //Execute the function.
```

What you need to know in javascript, that there is a function used to create new functions called `function()`, we pass the last arg as function as string.
```js
let test2 = Function('a', 'b', 'alert(a+b)');
test2(1,2); //alert(3)

Function('alert()')() //Creating and calling the function in one line.
```


And we have `constructor` property which is an `attribute` exists in each object that points to `constructor function` that created the object.
```js
function test(){alert('hello world')}

console.log(test.constructor) // we will find it points to Function() function.
```
In functions word, `constructor`attribute points to `Function()` that have created the function in the first place. 

So, we can create functions in this weird looking:
```js
let fun = test.constructor('alert(2)');
fun();

_____Same as______

Function fun(){alert(2)};

____Same as_______

let fun = Function('alert');
```

## AngularJS
Now in anguler, we can use any predefined function like `$eval`, `$on`.... And get its constructor to create new function that execute our code.
```
{{  $on.constructor('alert()')()  }}
```
- `$on.constructor`, Give us reference to `Function()` that is responsable for creating other functions, so we use it to create our code.
- we add `()` at the end `$on.constructor()()`, so we can execute the code immediately after we created it.
