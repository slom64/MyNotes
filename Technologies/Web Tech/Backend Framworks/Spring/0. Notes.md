- The Java Spring framework uses the `;` character to add parameters known as matrix variables. An origin server that uses Java Spring would therefore interpret `;` as a delimiter. It truncates the path after `/profile` and returns profile information. So, `GET /profile;font.css` it will truncate it to `GET /profile` which is useful in `cache deception`.
