- A server running the Ruby on Rails framework, uses `.` as a delimiter to specify the response format, This is useful for cache deception:
	- `/profile` - This request is processed by the default HTML formatter, which returns the user profile information.
	- `/profile.css` - This request is recognized as a CSS extension. There isn't a CSS formatter, so the request isn't accepted and an error is returned.
	- `/profile.ico` - This request uses the `.ico` extension, which isn't recognized by Ruby on Rails. The default is HTML formatter handles the request and returns the user profile information. In this situation, if the cache is configured to store responses for requests ending in `.ico`, it would cache and serve the profile information as if it were a static file.
