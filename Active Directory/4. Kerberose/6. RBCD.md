- Domain admin/equivalent rights **are not needed** to modify this field, as opposed to previous forms of delegation. The only right needed is the ability to edit this property on a computer object in Active Directory, so rights like `GenericAll`/`GenericWrite`/`WriteDacl`/etc. against the target computer object all apply here.
- If i didn't specify the service in SPN `<service>/hostname` that mean i have delegation to all services that are listed on RBCD server, ==THATS DANGER== because if the server has constrained/ unconstrained delegation to other services and we created RBCD on this server, the one who got the delegation right will be able to use those constrained/unconstrained delegations too.
  in other words, if you managed to put `RBCD`on computer that will make you inherite its delegations.
- This is called **delegation chaining** or **cross-domain/same-domain delegation attacks**.





```sh
impacket-describeTicket <ccache>
KRB5CCNAME=<ccache> impacket-getST -u2u -impersonate Administrator -spn TERMSRV/<RBCD machine> -no-pass <DOMAIN>/<user> -dc-ip <DC IP>
```


### Delegations inheritance
If `delagator$` has constrained delegation on `DC01$`, and `delegator$` doesn't have protocol transition enbled then it can't use S4U2Self. so we use `RBCD` it will enable us to ask ticket for anyone.
```sh
delegator$ ---Admin---> DC01$ # This can't happen because S4U2Self is disabled.
computer01$  ---Admin---> Delegator$ ---->  DC01$   # this will work 
```
