## what is it ?
When `pre-authentication` isn't required, we can request a TGT of any user, this TGT come with other message that contain `TGS session key` that is needed to use the TGT but this message is encrypted using user password so we need to crack this message to get the `TGS session key` and be able to use the `TGT`. success depends on the user having a relatively weak password.

`AS-REPRoasting` is similar to `Kerberoasting` but involves attacking `AS-REP` instead of `TGS-REP`.

## Targeted AS-REPRoasting
We can perform AS-REP rosting even if it require pre-authentication, Suppose an attacker has `GenericWrite` or `GenericAll` permissions over an account. In that case, they can enable this attribute and obtain the `AS_REP` ticket for offline cracking to recover the account's password before disabling it again.

#### AS-REPRoastable Users Enumeration
```sh
GetNPUsers.py inlanefreight.local/pixis
```
Now that we have a list of vulnerable accounts, we can request their hashes in Hashcat's format by adding the `-request` parameter to our command.
```sh
GetNPUsers.py inlanefreight.local/pixis -request           
```

#### Finding Vulnerable Accounts without Authentication
If we do not have credentials on the domain but have a username list, we can still find accounts that do not require pre-authentication. Using `GetNPUsers.py`, we can search for each account inside the file containing the user list to identify if there is a least one account vulnerable to this attack:
```
GetNPUsers.py INLANEFREIGHT/ -dc-ip 10.129.205.35 -usersfile /tmp/users.txt -format hashcat -outputfile /tmp/hashes.txt -no-pass
```
