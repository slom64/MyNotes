> [!Question] SPN association
> how does the SPN generated. is it a new AD user, or its a property that been set to machine account or Domain joined user.

In Windows Active Directory, when introducing a new service that requires Kerberos authentication (e.g., SQL Server, IIS, or a custom application), a Service Principal Name (SPN) is generated to uniquely identify the service instance. This enables clients to locate and authenticate to the service securely. 

An SPN is **not** a new Active Directory (AD) user object; instead, it is a multi-valued attribute (`servicePrincipalName`) set on an existing AD object—typically a computer (machine) account or a domain-joined user account (often called a service account).

---
### How SPNs Are Generated
SPNs follow a standardized format: `serviceclass/hostname:port/optional-service-name` (e.g., `HTTP/webserver.contoso.com:80`). The "generation" process isn't automatic in the sense of AD creating a new entity; it involves registering the SPN on the appropriate AD object. This can happen in two main ways:
1. **Automatic Registration**:
   - Many services (e.g., those running under system contexts like LocalSystem or NetworkService) can self-register their SPNs during startup or installation, provided the account has the necessary permissions (e.g., "Validated write to service principal name" on the computer object).
   - For domain-joined machines, this typically sets the SPN on the machine's computer account in AD (e.g., the object representing the server hosting the service).
1. **Manual Registration**:
   - Use tools like `setspn.exe` (built-in Windows utility) to add, view, or delete SPNs on an existing AD object. For example:
     - To set an SPN on a machine account: `setspn -S HTTP/webserver.contoso.com CONTOSO\WEBSERVER$`
     - To set an SPN on a domain user account (service account): `setspn -S HTTP/webserver.contoso.com CONTOSO\svc-webapp`
   - Other tools like `ktpass.exe` (for keytab generation in mixed environments) or PowerShell cmdlets (e.g., `Set-ADUser` or `Set-ADComputer`) can also configure SPNs.
   - This is common for services running under a dedicated domain user account, where the SPN is added as a property to that user's AD object.

### SPN Association with AD Objects
- **Machine Account (Computer Object)**: For services tied to the host machine (e.g., default IIS sites or SMB shares), the SPN is set on the domain-joined computer's AD object. This is common because services often run in the machine's security context.
- **Domain-Joined User Account**: For managed service accounts (`gMSAs`) or custom user-based service accounts, the SPN is added to the user object's attributes. This allows the service to run under a specific identity with delegated permissions.
- SPNs must be unique across the domain to avoid conflicts, and duplicates can cause authentication failures.

If the new service requires custom configuration or you're troubleshooting, always verify SPNs with `setspn -Q` or LDAP queries. For security, delegate SPN management carefully, as improper SPNs can lead to Kerberos issues or vulnerabilities like Kerberoasting.

> i mean if mssql it self want to make a request like accessing smb, how is the requester of the ticket? the SPN or account that have the SPN. (its computer1$ or mssqlSvc)
Perfect — that’s a _very_ insightful question, and it touches the **real heart** of how SPNs and service accounts interact in Kerberos.

## 🎯 Scenario

You have:
- A computer: `COMPUTER1$`
- A service: MSSQL, running either
    - as `LocalSystem` (i.e., under `COMPUTER1$`), or
    - as a **domain account** like `svc_mssql`.
SPN registered:
```
MSSQLSvc/computer1.domain.local:1433
```

This SPN is **bound to an AD account** — either `COMPUTER1$` (if the SQL service runs as LocalSystem) or `svc_mssql` (if it runs as a domain account).

---

## 🧠 Now the key question

> If SQL itself (the service) tries to access another resource (like SMB on a file share), **who requests the Kerberos ticket from the KDC**?

✅ **Answer:**  
It’s always the **account that the service is running under**, not the SPN itself.

---

### 🔍 Example 1 — MSSQL running as LocalSystem

- LocalSystem maps to the **machine account** `COMPUTER1$` in AD.
    
- If SQL Server connects to `\\fileserver\share` over SMB, it will need a ticket for `CIFS/fileserver.domain.local`.
    
- SQL will contact the KDC and request a TGS for that service **as the client = COMPUTER1$**.
    

So on the wire you’ll see:

```
Client principal: COMPUTER1$
Service principal: CIFS/fileserver.domain.local
```

---

### 🔍 Example 2 — MSSQL running as a domain account `svc_mssql`

Now SQL runs as a domain user `svc_mssql`, and the SPN `MSSQLSvc/computer1.domain.local:1433` is registered on **that** account.

If it needs to connect to SMB on another host, it uses its own credentials (the TGT of `svc_mssql`).

So:

```
Client principal: svc_mssql
Service principal: CIFS/fileserver.domain.local
```

Same idea — it’s the **account** who owns/uses the credentials that requests tickets, not the SPN name.

---

## 🧩 So what is the SPN doing then?

SPN = identifier for the **target service**.  
It is _not_ an actor or identity by itself.  
It just tells the KDC, “which service’s key to encrypt the ticket with.”

So when a _client connects to SQL_, it requests a TGS for `MSSQLSvc/computer1.domain.local:1433`.  
That TGS is encrypted with the key of the account that _owns_ that SPN (say `svc_mssql`).

But when _SQL_ (the service) needs to connect outbound to something else (SMB, LDAP, etc.), it acts as **whoever is running the service** (`svc_mssql` or `COMPUTER1$`) — and uses that identity to ask the KDC for tickets.

---

## 🔁 Summary Table

|Action|Running as|Who Requests Ticket|For Which SPN|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|User connects to MSSQL|User account|User|MSSQLSvc/computer1.domain.local:1433|Ticket encrypted with SQL’s account key|
|SQL connects to SMB|COMPUTER1$ (LocalSystem)|COMPUTER1$|CIFS/fileserver.domain.local|Machine account requests it|
|SQL connects to SMB|svc_mssql (domain account)|svc_mssql|CIFS/fileserver.domain.local|Service account requests it|

---

## ⚙️ Why this matters for attacks

If you compromise:

- A **service account** (e.g., `svc_mssql`), you can now authenticate as that account and access network resources it can reach.
    
- A **machine account** (`COMPUTER1$`), same idea — you can request tickets for other services as that computer.
    
- If the account has **unconstrained delegation**, it can impersonate any user whose TGT it receives, because it’s the account that _owns_ the SPN and _runs_ the service — it’s the one that performs the delegated actions.
    

---

So, to wrap it cleanly:

> 🧩 When a service makes a request to another service, **the Kerberos client principal is the account that runs that service** (machine or service account).  
> The **SPN** is just a _label_ used when _others_ request tickets **to** that service.

---

Would you like me to show you a **Wireshark capture example** of both cases (`LocalSystem` vs `svc_mssql`) with the Kerberos packets labeled (so you can literally see the `client` and `service` fields)?
