> how does the SPN generated. is it a new AD user, or its a property that been set to machine account or Domain joined user.

In Windows Active Directory, when introducing a new service that requires Kerberos authentication (e.g., SQL Server, IIS, or a custom application), a Service Principal Name (SPN) is generated to uniquely identify the service instance. This enables clients to locate and authenticate to the service securely. 

An SPN is **not** a new Active Directory (AD) user object; instead, it is a multi-valued attribute (`servicePrincipalName`) set on an existing AD objectâ€”typically a computer (machine) account or a domain-joined user account (often called a service account).

### How SPNs Are Generated
SPNs follow a standardized format: `serviceclass/hostname:port/optional-service-name` (e.g., `HTTP/webserver.contoso.com:80`). The "generation" process isn't automatic in the sense of AD creating a new entity; it involves registering the SPN on the appropriate AD object. This can happen in two main ways:
1. **Automatic Registration**:
   - Many services (e.g., those running under system contexts like LocalSystem or NetworkService) can self-register their SPNs during startup or installation, provided the account has the necessary permissions (e.g., "Validated write to service principal name" on the computer object).
   - For domain-joined machines, this typically sets the SPN on the machine's computer account in AD (e.g., the object representing the server hosting the service).
1. **Manual Registration**:
   - Use tools like `setspn.exe` (built-in Windows utility) to add, view, or delete SPNs on an existing AD object. For example:
     - To set an SPN on a machine account: `setspn -S HTTP/webserver.contoso.com CONTOSO\WEBSERVER$`
     - To set an SPN on a domain user account (service account): `setspn -S HTTP/webserver.contoso.com CONTOSO\svc-webapp`
   - Other tools like `ktpass.exe` (for keytab generation in mixed environments) or PowerShell cmdlets (e.g., `Set-ADUser` or `Set-ADComputer`) can also configure SPNs.
   - This is common for services running under a dedicated domain user account, where the SPN is added as a property to that user's AD object.

### SPN Association with AD Objects
- **Machine Account (Computer Object)**: For services tied to the host machine (e.g., default IIS sites or SMB shares), the SPN is set on the domain-joined computer's AD object. This is common because services often run in the machine's security context.
- **Domain-Joined User Account**: For managed service accounts (`gMSAs`) or custom user-based service accounts, the SPN is added to the user object's attributes. This allows the service to run under a specific identity with delegated permissions.
- SPNs must be unique across the domain to avoid conflicts, and duplicates can cause authentication failures.

If the new service requires custom configuration or you're troubleshooting, always verify SPNs with `setspn -Q` or LDAP queries. For security, delegate SPN management carefully, as improper SPNs can lead to Kerberos issues or vulnerabilities like Kerberoasting.
