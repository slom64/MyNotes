- kerberos is `centralize authentication` to avoid all services having to know every user's credentials.
- Services doesn't know the groups of the user. So, services relies on `TGS`to tell them what groups the user is joined to. thats why we add more groups in `silver ticktet`.
- Using MiTM to sniff `TGT` is useless, you can't use ticket by this method. But you can compromise extract and reuse tickets that are stored in the compromised machine.
