in kerbrosting attack we have valid credentials for one user so we can request tgt. now why we have access to the TGS for SPN. i find that wired

## 🔑 Kerberos Basics Refresher

1. **TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)**    
    - Proves you are authenticated to the KDC.
    - Encrypted with the **KRBTGT account key** (only the KDC can read).
    - You get this after logging in with valid credentials (or hash).
2. **TGS (Service Ticket)**
    - Lets you access a specific service (identified by its **SPN**, e.g. `MSSQLSvc/sql01.puppy.htb:1433`).
    - Encrypted with the **service account’s NTLM hash** (the password of the account running that service).

## 🚀 Why do we get TGS for _any_ SPN if we have just one user’s credentials?

This is by **design** in Kerberos:
- When you authenticate (valid creds → TGT), you are now a **valid domain user**.
- Any valid user in the domain can request a TGS for _any SPN_ (service) in the domain.
- The KDC doesn’t check “should this user be allowed to ask for this ticket?” → it assumes the **service itself** will later enforce authorization.

So the **KDC gives you the TGS** if you ask, but whether you can actually use it to access the service depends on ACLs.  
However, for Kerberoasting, we **don’t care about access**. We just want the **encrypted part of the TGS** (the service ticket encrypted with the service account’s key).

## 🔥 Why this enables Kerberoasting

- You (with _any_ valid account) → ask KDC:  
    “Give me a TGS for SPN `MSSQLSvc/sql01.puppy.htb`.”    
- KDC → gives you a TGS encrypted with the **MSSQL service account’s NTLM hash**.
- You can’t read it directly, but you can try to **brute-force / crack offline**.
- If successful → you now have the **service account’s plaintext password/hash**, which may be highly privileged (often Domain Admin in misconfigured environments).

## 🧠 The Key Idea

> **Kerberos does not restrict who can request service tickets.**  
> It assumes the service itself will check whether you are authorized.

That’s why with just **one valid low-priv user**, you can request TGS tickets for _any_ SPN in the domain and roast them offline.

## ⚖️ Analogy

Think of it like:
- Having a valid **library card** (TGT).
- You can now request a “sealed envelope” (TGS) for any book.
- The envelope is locked with the librarian’s key (service account password).
- You can’t open it, but you can take it home and try to **pick the lock** offline.

👉 Do you want me to also explain why **AS-REP roasting** is slightly different (and doesn’t require valid credentials at all)?
