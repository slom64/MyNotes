now i have question. how the CA validate the person how is requesting the certificate, like i can request a certificate of another person. what validation happens here? do we encrypt the request with our password? so the CA can know that we are who request the CA and we can't request other people certificates

Excellent question — you’re digging into the **heart of AD CS security** here 🔥.

Let’s break this down carefully:

---

## 1. How does the CA know “who” is making the request?

In an **Enterprise CA** (integrated with AD), the **authentication** of the requester is based on **Active Directory authentication** (`kerberos` or `NTLM`), not just the CSR.
Here’s what happens:

- When a client sends a certificate request (CSR) to the Enterprise CA, that request is sent over a channel (usually RPC/DCOM or HTTP with Windows authentication).    
- The client is already authenticated to AD (Kerberos or NTLM).
- The CA uses that **Windows logon identity** (the authenticated AD account) as the identity of the requester.

👉 So, if you’re logged in as `slom@corp.local`, the CA knows that _you_ made the request — because the RPC/HTTP request is authenticated with your `Kerberos TGT` or `NTLM` credentials.

---
## 2. What prevents you from requesting a cert for someone else?

This is where **certificate templates** come in.
Each template has **permissions** (Access Control List in AD):
- **Enroll**: who is allowed to request a cert based on this template.
- **Autoenroll**: who gets certs automatically.

When the CA processes your CSR:
- It checks the template specified in the request.
- It verifies whether **your authenticated AD account** has _Enroll_ (or Autoenroll) rights on that template.
- If not → request denied.

So, even if you send a CSR that says _“Subject = [Alice@corp.local](mailto:Alice@corp.local)”_, the CA won’t honor it unless the template allows you to request on behalf of Alice (rare, usually restricted to Enrollment Agents).

---

## 3. Do we sign/encrypt the request with our password?

Not directly.
- You don’t send your AD password in the CSR.
- Instead, your authentication to the CA server is handled by `Kerberos (or NTLM),` since you’re domain-joined.
- That’s how the CA knows “this request really came from user X.”

The CSR itself is just signed with the private key of the keypair you generated (to prove you own that key).

---

## 4. Special Case: Enrollment Agent Templates

There **are** cases where a user can request certificates _on behalf of other users_ — for example, smart card issuance by IT staff.

- In those cases, the CA requires the requester to have a special **Enrollment Agent certificate**.
- This template explicitly allows them to request certs for others.

Without that special delegation, a normal user cannot enroll for another user.

---

## 5. Why this matters for attacks

If certificate template permissions are misconfigured:

- A low-privileged user might be able to request a certificate for “Client Authentication” or “Smartcard Logon” with their own identity.
- Then they can use that cert to request Kerberos TGTs (PKINIT).
- This is how many AD CS **ESC (Escalation of Privilege) attacks** work.

---

✅ **Summary:**

- The CA identifies the requester using **AD authentication** (Kerberos/NTLM).
- It doesn’t rely on “password in CSR” — the CSR is just proof you own the key.
- Authorization is enforced by **certificate template ACLs**.
- You cannot normally request a cert for another user, unless given Enrollment Agent rights (or a misconfiguration exists).

very very nice, i just wanted to know how the CA knows my identity to it can prevent me from doing bad actions like requesting other people certificates. that happens using kerberose or NTLM. so it can see our username based on it can take actions

Exactly 👍 you got it.

When you (a domain-joined machine or user) talk to an **Enterprise CA**:
- The connection itself is authenticated with **Kerberos** (preferred) or **NTLM**.
- That means by the time your CSR even reaches the CA, the CA already knows _“this is user `DOMAIN\slom`”_.
- Then the CA uses that authenticated AD identity to check the **certificate template permissions**.

So the CSR ≠ your identity.  
The CSR only proves _“I control this keypair”_.  
Your AD session (Kerberos/NTLM) proves _“I am this AD account”_.

And combining the two is what allows the CA to safely issue certs.

💡 This is why in AD CS attacks (like ESC1–ESC8), the trick usually isn’t to forge CSRs — it’s to abuse **misconfigured template permissions** or **elevated enrollment rights**.

Do you want me to also show you how this ties into **authorization vs authentication** (like where AD is used and where the CA rules kick in)? That’s usually the next “aha” moment.
