# **1. Certification Authorities container**

📍 Location:

```
CN=Certification Authorities,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=Domain,DC=Local
```
### Purpose:
- Stores **trusted root certification authorities (Root CAs)**.
- Domain members use this to know **which CAs to trust** at a root level.
- Certificates listed here are automatically trusted by domain machines. Windows machines universally take these root CA certificates into their Trusted Root Certification Authorities store.
### Think of it like:
🟢 _"These are our root trusted certificate authorities—trust anything they sign."_

# **2. Enrollment Services container**
📍 Location:
```
CN=Enrollment Services,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=Domain,DC=Local
```
### Purpose:
- Lists **Enterprise CA servers** available in the domain.
- Defines **which certificate templates** each CA is allowed to issue.
- Used during **certificate enrollment** to determine available CAs.
### Contains:
- CA Name
- DNS/Server info of CA
- Certificate Templates it publishes
### Think of it like:
📜 _"These are the AD-integrated CAs and what certificates they can issue."_

---
# **3. NTAuthCertificates AD object**

📍 Location:

```
CN=NTAuthCertificates,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=Domain,DC=Local
```
### Purpose:
- Stores certificates used for **client authentication & smartcard logon**.
- Domain controllers check this when accepting cert-based logins (Kerberos PKINIT etc.).
If a CA certificate is **not in NTAuthCertificates**, users can't authenticate to AD using certificates issued by it.
### Think of it like:
🔑 _"Only certificates issued by CAs listed here are allowed for logon/authentication."_
This one often appears in attacks dealing with misconfigured or external CAs.

# **4. AIA (Authority Information Access) container**
📍 Location:
```
CN=AIA,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=Domain,DC=Local
```
### Purpose:
- Stores **CA certificates used for chaining/intermediate authority validation**.
- Helps systems locate issuing CA chains to verify certificate legitimacy.
- Used in certificate validation during TLS & authentication.
### Think of it like:
🔗 _"Here’s where to find intermediate CA certificates—follow this chain to validate."_
