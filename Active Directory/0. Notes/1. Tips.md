- `AddMember` can add and remove members from the group
- `Protected objects group`, if you have `Addmember` on it you can **remove** groups and members from this groups. And you can't change passwords or properties inside protected group. So remove groups then try to change there attributes.
- try to Compremise the local admin then try to go for other users in the domain. like getting admin in mssql, or running responder.
- Services doesn't know the domain users groups, it relies on `TGS` to tell it what groups does the user joined to, thats why you can add multiple groups in `silver` ticket.
- Sometimes getting reverse shell isn't good idea because of `UAC`, you can use the context of the running service ("EX. mssql") to read or execute commands because they already have elevated session. [[Signed]]
- Check the inheretance of privileges.
- if null session is enabled, and did  `-u 'slom' -p 'dummy'` you will get successful login. but if you put a real AD user `-u 'bob.w' -p 'dummy'` you will get invalide creds.
  which is useful information to validate if you have valid username.
- `GetUserSPNs` will show SPN of users, but it won't show you the SPN of user who is `group managed service account` `gMSA`. but you can see it with bloodyAD.
