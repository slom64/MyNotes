- Try simple `<>` see if it get filterd. look at original source of the page from `source` tab which show you `&lt;` if `<` is filters. be carful the other tab show you the html after getting modified .
- Then put all tags and attributes in burp intruder to guess what is possible and allowed.
- Sometimes you didn't need `<>` to perform XSS, that is the case when you dealing with [[Inside tag attributes]]. You should try `"` or `'`.
- If  `<>` and `"` , `'`  and  backslash`\` are escaped then try `HTML5_entities encoding`if we are in HTML context,
  don't pay attention to what is in `Source` look at inspect when doing this exploit. Example instead of `'` --> `&apos;`. this is useful to inject code in javascript.
- After all of that try `$(alert(1))` if you are inside `let x = `` `.
