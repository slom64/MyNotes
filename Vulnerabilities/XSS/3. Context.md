When testing for [reflected](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected) and [stored](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored) XSS, a key task is to identify the XSS context:
- The location within the response where attacker-controllable data appears.
- Any input validation or other processing that is being performed on that data by the application.

### Difference between reflected and stored?
reflected xss the payload get put in inside the html page.
Stored, the payload is in database then it get retrived inside the html so it get executed.
DOM, the javascript code is responsible of displaying the XSS code.
