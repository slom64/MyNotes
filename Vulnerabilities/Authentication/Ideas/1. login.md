### Username enumeration
if the page make changes in the website while putting valid users, we can guess the valid users.
#### While changing usernames:
- Check the `response code`, `response strings`, `response timing`.
- Use different headers, `X-Forwarded-For` to prevent blocking you.
- Use account lockout to make sure that username is valid.

Checklist
- [ ] Check response code, response size, response timing when submitting invalid login attempt.
- [ ] bypass IP blocking using `X-Forwarded-For` header.
- [ ] Use account locking to enum users.

### Password brute-forcing

The main mechanizems used to prevent password brute forcing is:
- Locking the account that the remote user is trying to access if they make too many failed login attempts
- Blocking the remote user's IP address if they make too many login attempts in quick succession

#### Ideas:
- If your IP get locked out after 3 invalid attempts,  try to do valid login attempt in 3rd request. you may be able to reset the counter.
- if your account get locked out, try to login after locking the account. if you found different error message "valid password but you are locked" that mean we can brute-force usernames and passwords.
- Multiple credentials,
```json
  `"username" : "carlos",
   "password" : [ 
				   "123456",
				    "passw1234",
				    "qwerty" ... 
				]`
```
