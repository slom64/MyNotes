- If the vulnerable code is executed in something like `hashchange`, `urlchange`... Any thing that should be changed in user browser, or need some user interaction like `onresize` Then we can use `<iframe>` and put what you want to change after it 
```html
<iframe src=http//lab.com# onload="this.src+='<img src=0 onerror=alert(1)>'" >
```

- use minus `-` when you have to deal with string --> `let abc= hello - alert(1) - ""`. this will make the function get executed even if its not valid.

- if you have `firstPElement.innerHTML = Controlled` and `newInnerHtml = firstPElement.innerHTML + Controlled` both exploitable using `img`. 
  but if `firstPElement.innerHTML = "<h1>"+ Controlled  + "</h1>"`. this one can't be exploited using `img`

- You don't need to add spaces between attribute and HTML will be able detect different attributes but you should put the value of the attributes in  `''`or `""`
```js
 <a href='academy.net/?'accesskey='X'onclick='alert(1)'/>
```

- if you have `https://asdf.com?at=ControlledValue` you can still use valid `at` by putting `&`. `https://asdf.com?at=x&dummy=abc`

- You can use `/**/` if spaces is blocked in HTML.

- if function in javascript accept only 2 arguements "Ex. `fetch()`", the function will take the first 2 arguments but if we add more than 2 `fetch(1,2,custome())`
  we can execute functions in the additional arguments, best function to start with is declaration function, then override well known function in javascript with this custom function then call it `fetch(1,2, a=x=>{throw/**/onerror=alert,1337} , toString=a , window+"")`

- In `.html` page that contain script if you have put in your input `'` it may be used to terminate the js code, but this won't work in `.js` page.

- `Reflected-Xss` can be very useful for bypassing `SameSite` restrictions, so you can combine it with `CSRF`.
