## Exploiting cache key flaws
- **Unkeyed port**. Try `Host: abc.com:123xyz`
- **Unkeyed query string**: Put cache puster in place other than query parameters for testing, try 
- **Unkeyed query parameters**: some websites only exclude specific query parameters, Example: `utm_content`
- **Cache parameter cloaking**: discrepancies between cache and backend. 
	- `;` is treat as `&` in Ruby. `GET /?keyed_param=abc&excluded_param=123;keyed_param=bad-stuff-here`
		- You need the `&` because if you didn't use it, The cache will treat keyed_param as `abc;keyed_param=bad-stuff-here`, which is not normal user request.
	- Use multiple `?`, `GET /?example=123?excluded_param=bad-stuff-here`
	- **Exploiting fat GET support**: 
		- Put request parameters in the body. 
		- Try put `X-HTTP-Method-Override: POST` if GET only isn't accepted. 
	- **Exploiting dynamic content in resource imports**: 
- **Normalized cache keys**
- **Cache key injection**
- **Internal cache poisoning**

### Cache key flaws

Generally speaking, websites take most of their input from the URL path and the query string. As a result, this is a well-trodden attack surface for various hacking techniques. However, as the request line is usually part of the cache key, these inputs have traditionally not been considered suitable for cache poisoning. Any payload injected via keyed inputs would act as a cache buster, meaning your poisoned cache entry would almost certainly never be served to any other users.

On closer inspection, however, the behavior of individual caching systems is not always as you would expect. In practice, many websites and CDNs perform various transformations on keyed components when they are saved in the cache key. This can include:

- Excluding the query string
- Filtering out specific query parameters
- Normalizing input in keyed components

These transformations may introduce a few unexpected quirks. These are primarily based around discrepancies between the data that is written to the cache key and the data that is passed into the application code, even though it all stems from the same input. These cache key flaws can be exploited to poison the cache via inputs that may initially appear unusable.

In the case of fully integrated, application-level caches, these quirks can be even more extreme. In fact, internal caches can be so unpredictable that it is sometimes difficult to test them at all without inadvertently poisoning the cache for live users.

### Cache probing methodology
1. Identify a suitable cache oracle
2. Probe key handling
3. Identify an exploitable gadget
#### Identify a suitable cache oracle

The first step is to identify a suitable "cache oracle" that you can use for testing. A cache oracle is simply a page or endpoint that provides feedback about the cache's behavior. This needs to be cacheable and must indicate in some way whether you received a cached response or a response directly from the server. This feedback could take various forms, such as:
- **An HTTP header that explicitly tells you whether you got a cache hit**
- **Observable changes to dynamic content**
- **Distinct response times**

Ideally, the cache oracle will also reflect the entire URL and at least one query parameter in the response. This will make it easier to notice parsing discrepancies between the cache and the application, which will be useful for constructing different exploits later.

If you can identify that a specific third-party cache is being used, you can also consult the corresponding documentation. This may contain information about how the default cache key is constructed. You might even stumble across some handy tips and tricks, such as features that allow you to see the cache key directly. For example, Akamai-based websites may support the header `Pragma: akamai-x-get-cache-key`, which you can use to display the cache key in the response headers:

```http
GET /?param=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: innocent-website.com
Pragma: akamai-x-get-cache-key

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Cache-Key: innocent-website.com/?param=1
```

#### Probe key handling

The next step is to investigate whether the cache performs any additional processing of your input when generating the cache key. You are looking for an additional attack surface hidden within seemingly keyed components.

You should specifically look at any transformation that is taking place. Is anything being excluded from a keyed component when it is added to the cache key? Common examples are excluding specific query parameters, or even the entire query string, and removing the port from the `Host` header.

If you're fortunate enough to have direct access to the cache key, you can simply compare the key after injecting different inputs. Otherwise, you can use your understanding of the cache oracle to infer whether you received the correct cached response. For each case that you want to test, you send two similar requests and compare the responses.

Let's say that our hypothetical cache oracle is the target website's home page. This automatically redirects users to a region-specific page. It uses the `Host` header to dynamically generate the `Location` header in the response:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com

HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Permanently
Location: https://vulnerable-website.com/en
Cache-Status: miss
```

To test whether the port is excluded from the cache key, we first need to request an arbitrary port and make sure that we receive a fresh response from the server that reflects this input:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com:1337

HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Permanently
Location: https://vulnerable-website.com:1337/en
Cache-Status: miss
```

Next, we'll send another request, but this time we won't specify a port:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com

HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Permanently
Location: https://vulnerable-website.com:1337/en
Cache-Status: hit
```

As you can see, we have been served our cached response even though the `Host` header in the request does not specify a port. This proves that the port is being excluded from the cache key. Importantly, the full header is still passed into the application code and reflected in the response.

In short, although the `Host` header is keyed, the way it is transformed by the cache allows us to pass a payload into the application while still preserving a "normal" cache key that will be mapped to other users' requests. This kind of behavior is the key concept behind all of the exploits that we'll discuss in this section.

You can use a similar approach to investigate any other processing of your input by the cache. Is your input being normalized in any way? How is your input stored? Do you notice any anomalies? We'll cover how to answer these questions later using concrete examples.

#### Identify an exploitable gadget

By now, you should have a relatively solid understanding of how the target website's cache behaves and might have found some interesting flaws in the way the cache key is constructed. The final step is to identify a suitable gadget that you can chain with this cache key flaw. This is an important skill because the severity of any web cache poisoning attack is heavily dependent on the gadget you are able to exploit.

These gadgets will often be classic client-side vulnerabilities, such as reflected XSS and open redirects. By combining these with web cache poisoning, you can massively escalate the severity of these attacks, turning a reflected vulnerability into a stored one. Instead of having to induce a victim to visit a specially crafted URL, your payload will automatically be served to anybody who visits the ordinary, perfectly legitimate URL.

Perhaps even more interestingly, these techniques enable you to exploit a number of unclassified vulnerabilities that are often dismissed as "unexploitable" and left unpatched. This includes the use of dynamic content in resource files, and exploits requiring malformed requests that a browser would never send.

---
### Unkeyed port

The `Host` header is often part of the cache key and, as such, initially seems an unlikely candidate for injecting any kind of payload. However, some caching systems will parse the header and exclude the port from the cache key.

In this case, you can potentially use this header for web cache poisoning. For example, consider the case we saw earlier where a redirect URL was dynamically generated based on the `Host` header. This might enable you to construct a denial-of-service attack by simply adding an arbitrary port to the request. All users who browsed to the home page would be redirected to a dud port, effectively taking down the home page until the cache expired.

This kind of attack can be escalated further if the website allows you to specify a non-numeric port. You could use this to inject an XSS payload, for example.

---
### Unkeyed query string

Like the `Host` header, the request line is typically keyed. However, one of the most common cache-key transformations is to exclude the entire query string.

#### Detecting an unkeyed query string

If the response explicitly tells you whether you got a cache hit or not, this transformation is relatively simple to spot - but what if it doesn't? This has the side-effect of making dynamic pages appear as though they are fully static because it can be hard to know whether you are communicating with the cache or the server.

To identify a dynamic page, you would normally observe how changing a parameter value has an effect on the response. But if the query string is unkeyed, most of the time you would still get a cache hit, and therefore an unchanged response, regardless of any parameters you add. Clearly, this also makes classic cache-buster query parameters redundant.

Fortunately, there are alternative ways of adding a cache buster, such as adding it to a keyed header that doesn't interfere with the application's behavior. Some typical examples include:
```http
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, cachebuster
Accept: */*, text/cachebuster
Cookie: cachebuster=1
Origin: https://cachebuster.vulnerable-website.com
```

If you use Param Miner, you can also select the options "Add static/dynamic cache buster" and "Include cache busters in headers". It will then automatically add a cache buster to commonly keyed headers in any requests that you send using Burp's manual testing tools.

Another approach is to see whether there are any discrepancies between how the cache and the back-end normalize the path of the request. As the path is almost guaranteed to be keyed, you can sometimes exploit this to issue requests with different keys that still hit the same endpoint. For example, the following entries might all be cached separately but treated as equivalent to `GET /` on the back-end:

Apache: `GET //   `Nginx: `GET /%2F   `PHP: `GET /index.php/xyz   `.NET `GET /(A(xyz)/   `

This transformation can sometimes mask what would otherwise be glaringly obvious reflected XSS vulnerabilities. If penetration testers or automated scanners only receive cached responses without realizing, it can appear as though there is no reflected XSS on the page.

#### Exploiting an unkeyed query string

Excluding the query string from the cache key can actually make these reflected XSS vulnerabilities even more severe.

Usually, such an attack would rely on inducing the victim to visit a maliciously crafted URL. However, poisoning the cache via an unkeyed query string would cause the payload to be served to users who visit what would otherwise be a perfectly normal URL. This has the potential to impact a far greater number of victims with no further interaction from the attacker.

---
### Unkeyed query parameters

So far we've seen that on some websites, the entire query string is excluded from the cache key. But some websites only exclude specific query parameters that are not relevant to the back-end application, such as parameters for analytics or serving targeted advertisements. UTM parameters like `utm_content` are good candidates to check during testing.

Parameters that have been excluded from the cache key are unlikely to have a significant impact on the response. The chances are there won't be any useful gadgets that accept input from these parameters. That said, some pages handle the entire URL in a vulnerable manner, making it possible to exploit arbitrary parameters.

---
### Cache parameter cloaking

If the cache excludes a harmless parameter from the cache key, and you can't find any exploitable gadgets based on the full URL, you'd be forgiven for thinking that you've reached a dead end. However, this is actually where things can get interesting.

If you can work out how the cache parses the URL to identify and remove the unwanted parameters, you might find some interesting quirks. Of particular interest are any parsing discrepancies between the cache and the application. This can potentially allow you to sneak arbitrary parameters into the application logic by "cloaking" them in an excluded parameter.

For example, the de facto standard is that a parameter will either be preceded by a question mark (`?`), if it's the first one in the query string, or an ampersand (`&`). Some poorly written parsing algorithms will treat any `?` as the start of a new parameter, regardless of whether it's the first one or not.

Let's assume that the algorithm for excluding parameters from the cache key behaves in this way, but the server's algorithm only accepts the first `?` as a delimiter. Consider the following request:

`GET /?example=123?excluded_param=bad-stuff-here`

In this case, the cache would identify two parameters and exclude the second one from the cache key. However, the server doesn't accept the second `?` as a delimiter and instead only sees one parameter, `example`, whose value is the entire rest of the query string, including our payload. If the value of `example` is passed into a useful gadget, we have successfully injected our payload without affecting the cache key.

#### Exploiting parameter parsing quirks

Similar parameter cloaking issues can arise in the opposite scenario, where the back-end identifies distinct parameters that the cache does not. The Ruby on Rails framework, for example, interprets both ampersands (&) and semicolons (;) as delimiters. When used in conjunction with a cache that does not allow this, you can potentially exploit another quirk to override the value of a keyed parameter in the application logic.

Consider the following request:

`GET /?keyed_param=abc&excluded_param=123;keyed_param=bad-stuff-here`

As the names suggest, `keyed_param` is included in the cache key, but `excluded_param` is not. Many caches will only interpret this as two parameters, delimited by the ampersand:

1. `keyed_param=abc`
2. `excluded_param=123;keyed_param=bad-stuff-here`

Once the parsing algorithm removes the `excluded_param`, the cache key will only contain `keyed_param=abc`. On the back-end, however, Ruby on Rails sees the semicolon and splits the query string into three separate parameters:

1. `keyed_param=abc`
2. `excluded_param=123`
3. `keyed_param=bad-stuff-here`

But now there is a duplicate `keyed_param`. This is where the second quirk comes into play. If there are duplicate parameters, each with different values, Ruby on Rails gives precedence to the final occurrence. The end result is that the cache key contains an innocent, expected parameter value, allowing the cached response to be served as normal to other users. On the back-end, however, the same parameter has a completely different value, which is our injected payload. It is this second value that will be passed into the gadget and reflected in the poisoned response.

This exploit can be especially powerful if it gives you control over a function that will be executed. For example, if a website is using JSONP to make a cross-domain request, this will often contain a `callback` parameter to execute a given function on the returned data:

`GET /jsonp?callback=innocentFunction`

In this case, you could use these techniques to override the expected callback function and execute arbitrary JavaScript instead.

---
#### Exploiting fat GET support

In select cases, the HTTP method may not be keyed. This might allow you to poison the cache with a `POST` request containing a malicious payload in the body. Your payload would then even be served in response to users' `GET` requests. Although this scenario is pretty rare, you can sometimes achieve a similar effect by simply adding a body to a `GET` request to create a "fat" `GET` request:

`GET /?param=innocent HTTP/1.1 … param=bad-stuff-here`

In this case, the cache key would be based on the request line, but the server-side value of the parameter would be taken from the body.

This is only possible if a website accepts `GET` requests that have a body, but there are potential workarounds. You can sometimes encourage "fat `GET`" handling by overriding the HTTP method, for example:

`GET /?param=innocent HTTP/1.1 Host: innocent-website.com X-HTTP-Method-Override: POST … param=bad-stuff-here`

As long as the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header is unkeyed, you could submit a pseudo-`POST` request while preserving a `GET` cache key derived from the request line.

#### Exploiting dynamic content in resource imports

Imported resource files are typically static but some reflect input from the query string. This is mostly considered harmless because browsers rarely execute these files when viewed directly, and an attacker has no control over the URLs used to load a page's subresources. However, by combining this with web cache poisoning, you can occasionally inject content into the resource file.

For example, consider a page that reflects the current query string in an import statement:

`GET /style.css?excluded_param=123);@import… HTTP/1.1 HTTP/1.1 200 OK … @import url(/site/home/index.part1.8a6715a2.css?excluded_param=123);@import…`

You could exploit this behavior to inject malicious CSS that exfiltrates sensitive information from any pages that import `/style.css`.

If the page importing the CSS file doesn't specify a `doctype`, you can maybe even exploit static CSS files. Given the right configuration, browsers will simply scour the document looking for CSS and then execute it. This means that you can occasionally poison static CSS files by triggering a server error that reflects the excluded query parameter:

`GET /style.css?excluded_param=alert(1)%0A{}*{color:red;} HTTP/1.1 HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/html … This request was blocked due to…alert(1){}*{color:red;}`This is only possible if a website accepts `GET` requests that have a body, but there are potential workarounds. You can sometimes encourage "fat `GET`" handling by overriding the HTTP method, for example:

`GET /?param=innocent HTTP/1.1 Host: innocent-website.com X-HTTP-Method-Override: POST … param=bad-stuff-here`

As long as the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header is unkeyed, you could submit a pseudo-`POST` request while preserving a `GET` cache key derived from the request line.

#### Exploiting dynamic content in resource imports

Imported resource files are typically static but some reflect input from the query string. This is mostly considered harmless because browsers rarely execute these files when viewed directly, and an attacker has no control over the URLs used to load a page's subresources. However, by combining this with web cache poisoning, you can occasionally inject content into the resource file.

For example, consider a page that reflects the current query string in an import statement:

`GET /style.css?excluded_param=123);@import… HTTP/1.1 HTTP/1.1 200 OK … @import url(/site/home/index.part1.8a6715a2.css?excluded_param=123);@import…`

You could exploit this behavior to inject malicious CSS that exfiltrates sensitive information from any pages that import `/style.css`.

If the page importing the CSS file doesn't specify a `doctype`, you can maybe even exploit static CSS files. Given the right configuration, browsers will simply scour the document looking for CSS and then execute it. This means that you can occasionally poison static CSS files by triggering a server error that reflects the excluded query parameter:

`GET /style.css?excluded_param=alert(1)%0A{}*{color:red;} HTTP/1.1 HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/html … This request was blocked due to…alert(1){}*{color:red;}`

---
### Normalized cache keys

Any normalization applied to the cache key can also introduce exploitable behavior. In fact, it can occasionally enable some exploits that would otherwise be almost impossible.

For example, when you find reflected XSS in a parameter, it is often unexploitable in practice. This is because modern browsers typically URL-encode the necessary characters when sending the request, and the server doesn't decode them. The response that the intended victim receives will merely contain a harmless URL-encoded string.

Some caching implementations normalize keyed input when adding it to the cache key. In this case, both of the following requests would have the same key:

```
GET /example?param="><test>
GET /example?param=%22%3e%3ctest%3e
```

This behavior can allow you to exploit these otherwise "unexploitable" XSS vulnerabilities. If you send a malicious request using Burp Repeater, you can poison the cache with an unencoded XSS payload. When the victim visits the malicious URL, the payload will still be URL-encoded by their browser; however, once the URL is normalized by the cache, it will have the same cache key as the response containing your unencoded payload.

As a result, the cache will serve the poisoned response and the payload will be executed client-side. You just need to make sure that the cache is poisoned when the victim visits the URL.

---
### Cache key injection

You will sometimes discover a client-side vulnerability in a keyed header. This is also a classic "unexploitable" issue that can sometimes be exploited using cache poisoning.

Keyed components are often bundled together in a string to create the cache key. If the cache doesn't implement proper escaping of the delimiters between the components, you can potentially exploit this behavior to craft two different requests that have the same cache key.

The following example uses double-underscores to delimit different components in the cache key and does not escape them. You can exploit this by first poisoning the cache with a request containing your payload in the corresponding keyed header:

```http
GET /path?param=123 HTTP/1.1
Origin: '-alert(1)-'__

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Cache-Key: /path?param=123__Origin='-alert(1)-'__

<script>…'-alert(1)-'…</script>
```

If you then induce a victim user to visit the following URL, they would be served the poisoned response:

```http
GET /path?param=123__Origin='-alert(1)-'__ HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Cache-Key: /path?param=123__Origin='-alert(1)-'__
X-Cache: hit

<script>…'-alert(1)-'…</script>
```

---
## Poisoning internal caches

So far, we've looked at how you can exploit flaws in the way external web caches are implemented to expose an extended attack surface hidden within seemingly keyed components. However, some websites implement caching behavior directly into the application in addition to using a distinct, external component. This can have several advantages, such as avoiding the kind of parsing discrepancies we looked at earlier.

As these integrated caches are purpose-built for the specific application, this also gives developers the freedom to tailor their behavior to a greater degree. As a result, these caches can sometimes behave in unusual ways that you wouldn't typically see from a more standardized, external cache that needs to be compatible with multiple applications. Sometimes, these strange behaviors can also provide an opportunity for some high-severity cache poisoning exploits.

Instead of caching entire responses, some of these caches break the response down into reusable fragments and cache them each separately. For example, a snippet for importing a widely used resource might be stored as a standalone cache entry. Users might then receive a response comprising a mixture of content from the server, as well as several individual fragments from the cache.

As these cached fragments are intended to be reusable across multiple distinct responses, the concept of a cache key doesn't really apply. Every response that contains a given fragment will reuse the same cached fragment, even if the rest of the response is completely different. In a scenario like this, poisoning the cache can have wide-reaching effects, especially if you poison a fragment that is used on every page. As there is no cache key, you would have poisoned every page, for every user, with a single request.

This will often only require you to use basic web cache poisoning techniques, such as manipulating the `Host` header.

### How to identify internal caches

One of the challenges posed by integrated, application-level caches is that they can be difficult to identify and investigate because there is often no user-facing feedback. To identify these caches, you can look for a few tell-tale signs.

For example, if the response reflects a mixture of both input from the last request you sent and input from a previous request, this is a key indicator that the cache is storing fragments rather than entire responses. The same applies if your input is reflected in responses on multiple distinct pages, in particular on pages in which you never tried to inject your input.

Other times, the cache's behavior may simply be so unusual that the most logical conclusion is that it must be a unique and specialized internal cache.

When a website implements multiple layers of caching, it can make it difficult to comprehend what is happening behind the scenes and understand how the website's caching system behaves.

### Testing internal caches safely

When testing ordinary web caches, we recommend using a cache buster to prevent your poisoned response from being served to other users. However, if an integrated cache has no concept of cache keys, then traditional cache busters are useless. This means that it's very easy to accidentally poison the cache for genuine users.

Therefore, it is important that you do your best to mitigate the potential damage when testing these kinds of vulnerabilities. Think carefully about the effect of your injected payload before sending each request. In particular, you should make sure that you only poison the cache using a domain that you control, rather than some arbitrary "`evil-user.net`". This way, you are in control of what happens next if something goes wrong.
