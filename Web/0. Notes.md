- `JSON.parse()` isn't vulnerable to prototype pollution, but developers make common mistakes with it. it will be vulnerable if:
	- object merge
	- property copy
	- assignment like `obj[key] = value` where `key` is attacker-controlled
	- recursive traversal
	- if the code use it like `document.asdf= json.parse().valueOne` then this is normal assignment and there is no issue here.
- `webCache deception` +` csrf` attack: deception attack will enable us to see the victim csrf token, then we inject this token in csrf poc.
- `WebCache Poisoing` + `Reflected XSS`. The main issue in Reflected XSS is encoding, even if the user press malicious link, the browser may do encdoing and the backend doesn't decode it. so Cache Poisoning come to play.
