- Modern browsers **normalize URLs before sending the request**, which includes resolving dot-segments (`.` and `..`). As a result, path traversal sequences such as `../` are removed during normalization. However, if traversal characters are **percent-encoded** (e.g., `..%2F`), normalization may be deferred to the server, depending on how the server and framework perform URL decoding.
