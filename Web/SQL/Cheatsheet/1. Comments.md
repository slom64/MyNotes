- You can use comments to truncate a query and remove the portion of the original query that follows your input.
- You can use the idea that there should be space in MySQL after ‘--’, to make sure of type of database.

|Database||
|---|---|
|Oracle|--comment|
|Microsoft|--comment /*comment*/|
|PostgreSQL|--comment /*comment*/|
|MySQL|#comment -- comment [Note the space after the double dash] /*comment*/|
