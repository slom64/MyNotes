## Classic Exploits
- **Using HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security controls**: Bypass access controles to access internal resources like `/admin`.  
- **Revealing front-end request rewriting**:
	- Front-end will put additional headers for every request it comes out towards backend, "even the smuggled one"
	- Try to find element or request that reflects the POST request output to exfiltrate data.
- **Bypassing client authentication**: 
	- If there is mutual TLS authentication between front-end and browser using certificate, many front-end pass `X-SSL-CLIENT-CN: administrator` header to backend as authentication.
- **Capturing other users' requests**
	- Find element or request that reflects the POST request output to exfiltrate user data like session cookie, MAKE SURE TO HAVE smuggled Content-length bigger than the normal request.
	- Limitation is you can capture data until the first occurrence of `&`.
- **Using HTTP request smuggling to exploit reflected XSS**
	- If there is reflected XSS you can smuggle requests to trigger it on other users browsers.
- **Using HTTP request smuggling to turn an on-site redirect into an open redirect**
	- Many applications perform on-site redirects from one URL to another and place the hostname from the request's `Host:` header into the redirect URL. `Apache and IIS`
	- In some cases, you may encounter server-level redirects that use the path to construct a root-relative URL for the `Location` header:
```http
GET //attacker-website.com/example HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: //attacker-website.com/example/
```
- **Using HTTP request smuggling to perform web cache poisoning**
- **Using HTTP request smuggling to perform web cache deception**
