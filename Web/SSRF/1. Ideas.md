- You may be able to access pages that aren't accessable from outsite like `127.0.0.1/adminPanel`.
- Try to enumerate the internal network for any IP that may serve an HTTP. `192.168.0.68/admin`
- Some application have blacklist to prevent using `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`, So what we can do:
	- Use different forms of `127.0.0.1`: `2130706433`, `017700000001`, `127.1`.
	- Register your own domain name that resolves to `127.0.0.1`. You can use `spoofed.burpcollaborator.net` for this purpose.
	- Obfuscate blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation.
	- Provide a URL that you control, which redirects to the target URL. Try using different redirect codes, as well as different protocols for the target URL. For example, switching from an `http:` to `https:` URL during the redirect has been shown to bypass some anti-SSRF filters.
- SSRF with **whitelist**, you may try to give it what it want by one of those or combine them:
	- You can embed credentials in a URL before the hostname, using the `@` character. For example: 
	  `https://expected-host:fakepassword@evil-host`
	- You can use the `#` character to indicate a URL fragment. For example: 
	  `https://evil-host#expected-host` or `https://evil-host?page=2&sort=asc#expected-host`
	- You can leverage the DNS naming hierarchy to place required input into a fully-qualified DNS name that you control. For example:
	  `https://expected-host.evil-host`
	- You can URL-encode characters to confuse the URL-parsing code. This is particularly useful if the code that implements the filter handles URL-encoded characters differently than the code that performs the back-end HTTP request. You can also try [double-encoding](https://portswigger.net/web-security/essential-skills/obfuscating-attacks-using-encodings#obfuscation-via-double-url-encoding) characters; some servers recursively URL-decode the input they receive, which can lead to further discrepancies.
	  `http://evil-host%2523@expected-host`
	- **Open redirect + SSRF ((Double redirect))**
		- if we have very strong validation on SSRF in sensitive URL, then we will try to find an open redirect in the server: 
		  `http://victem.com/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=6&path=http://evil-user.net`, this will make openRedirect Now we want the server to use this redirection,
		   this URL have very good property which is that it is inside the domain of the server So the actual sensitve URL won't suspect this vulnerable URL. So You can leverage the open redirection vulnerability to bypass the URL filter, and exploit the SSRF vulnerability as follows:
			   1. The Strong Sensitve URL `http://victem.com/product/stock?stockApi=/product/stock/check?productId=1&storeId=1`, you can't put any outside domain in `stockApi`.
			   2. Open redirect `http://victem.com/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=1&path=/product?productId=4`, you can tamper the `path` so the page will redirect to your input.
			   3. Give the Strong Url, the vulnerable url. that mean (( Strong_url ==-- Redirect -->== vulnerable_url ==-- Redirect -->== your_input ))
			 `http://victem.com/product/stock?stockApi=http://victem.com/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=1%26path=http://192.168.12.0/admin/delete?username=carlos`
