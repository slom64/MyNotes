## Server side
- if you found JSON **POST**, **PUT** requests. That would be worth testing for prototype pollution, because many developers may handle them improperly.



## Client side 
- prototype is the same concept as classes in java, which contain methods, attributes.
	- `asdf.prototype`,`asdf["prototype"]`: gives you the current object prototype.
	- `asdf.__proto__`, `asdf["__proto__"]`: gives you the parent prototype of the current object.
