## Finding GraphQL endpoints
### Universal queries

If you send `query{__typename}` to any GraphQL endpoint, it will include the string `{"data": {"__typename": "query"}}` somewhere in its response. This is known as a universal query, and is a useful tool in probing whether a URL corresponds to a GraphQL service.

The query works because every GraphQL endpoint has a reserved field called `__typename` that returns the queried object's type as a string.

### Common endpoint names

GraphQL services often use similar endpoint suffixes. When testing for GraphQL endpoints, you should look to send universal queries to the following locations:

- `/graphql`
- `/api`
- `/api/graphql`
- `/graphql/api`
- `/graphql/graphql`

If these common endpoints don't return a GraphQL response, you could also try appending `/v1` to the path.

> [!NOTE]
> GraphQL services will often respond to any non-GraphQL request with a "query not present" or similar error. You should bear this in mind when testing for GraphQL endpoints.

### Request methods

The next step in trying to find GraphQL endpoints is to test using different request methods.

It is best practice for production GraphQL endpoints to only accept POST requests that have a content-type of `application/json`, as this helps to protect against CSRF vulnerabilities. However, some endpoints may accept alternative methods, such as GET requests or POST requests that use a content-type of `x-www-form-urlencoded`.

If you can't find the GraphQL endpoint by sending POST requests to common endpoints, try resending the universal query using alternative HTTP methods.

### Initial testing

Once you have discovered the endpoint, you can send some test requests to understand a little more about how it works. If the endpoint is powering a website, try exploring the web interface in Burp's browser and use the HTTP history to examine the queries that are sent.
