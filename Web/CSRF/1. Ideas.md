- Note that some simple CSRF exploits employ the GET method and can be fully self-contained with a single URL on the vulnerable website. In this situation, the attacker may not need to employ an external site, and can directly feed victims a malicious URL on the vulnerable domain. In the preceding example, if the request to change email address can be performed with the GET method, then a self-contained attack would look like this:
```html
<img src="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change?email=pwned@evil-user.net">
```
