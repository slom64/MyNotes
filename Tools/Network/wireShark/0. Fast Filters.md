## Kerberos

```
kerberos.msg_type == 10                   # Try different number 
```


> [!NOTE] Kerberos encryption for hashcat
> If you found encryption string "Like timestamp in AS-req". you need to modify it in order to make hashcat understand it.

Example Modifying encryption string to be accepted in hashcat:
```

$krb5pa$18$USER$REALM$<encrypted timestamp>
$krb5pa$18$Lion.SK$CERTIFICATE.HTB$23f5159fa1c66ed7b0e561543eba6c010cd31f7e4a4377c2925cf306b98ed1e4f3951a50bc083c9bc0f16f0f586181c9d4ceda3fb5e852f0
```


> [!NOTE] Kerberos hashcat mode
> Hashcat have different modes for kerberos. It has AS-(req rep), TGS-(req rep)...etc, So depend on that you will determine which string modification should happen `$krb5pa$18$` `$krb5pa$20000$`. etc
