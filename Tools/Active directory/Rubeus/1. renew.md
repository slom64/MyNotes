`/ticket:X` supplied. This value can be a base64 encoding of a .kirbi file or the path to a .kirbi file on disk. If a `/dc` is not specified, the computer's current domain controller is extracted and used as the destination for the renewal traffic. The `/ptt` flag will "pass-the-ticket" and apply the resulting Kerberos credential to the current logon session.

```powershell
./Rubeus.exe renew /ticket:doIFVjCCBVKgAwIBBaEDA<SNIP> /ptt
```

The `/autorenew` flag will take an existing `/ticket:X` .kirbi file/blob, sleep until endTime-30 minutes, auto-renew the ticket and display the refreshed ticket blob. It will continue this renewal process until the allowable renew-till renewal window passes.
