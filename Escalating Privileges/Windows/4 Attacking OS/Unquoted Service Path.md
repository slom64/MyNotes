#### Searching for Unquoted Service Paths
We can identify unquoted service binary paths using the command below.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i "auto" | findstr /i /v "c:\windows\\" | findstr /i /v """
GVFS.Service                                                                        GVFS.Service                              C:\Program Files\GVFS\GVFS.Service.exe                                                 Auto
System Explorer Service                                                             SystemExplorerHelpService                 C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\service\SystemExplorerService64.exe             Auto
WindscribeService       
```

When a service is installed, the registry configuration specifies a path to the binary that should be executed on service start. If this binary is not encapsulated within quotes, Windows will attempt to locate the binary in different folders. Take the example binary path below.

```shell-session
C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\service\SystemExplorerService64.exe
```

Windows will decide the execution method of a program based on its file extension, so it's not necessary to specify it. Windows will attempt to load the following potential executables in order on service start, with a .exe being implied:
- `C:\Program`
- `C:\Program Files`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\System`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\service\SystemExplorerService64`
If we can create the following files, we would be able to hijack the service binary and gain command execution in the context of the service, in this case, `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
- `C:\Program.exe\`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\System.exe`

#### Querying Service
```cmd-session
C:\htb> sc qc SystemExplorerHelpService

[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS
