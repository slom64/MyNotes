# Access to agent's local ports (127.0.0.1)

If you need to access the local ports of the currently connected agent, there's a "magic" CIDR hardcoded in Ligolo-ng: `240.0.0.0/4` (This is an unused IPv4 subnet). If you query an IP address on this subnet, Ligolo-ng will automatically redirect traffic to the agent's local IP address (127.0.0.1).

```sh
sudo ip route add 240.0.0.1/32 dev ligolo 

nmap 240.0.0.1 -sV
