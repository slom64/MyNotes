Its all about understandeing listeners, you can add listener and tell ligolo agent how to deal with connection to specific port, Example: redirect every connection that comes to the `agent` from port 4444 to another ip address `"my nc IP"`.
```sh
[Agent : root@f5eb774507f2] » listener_add --addr 0.0.0.0:4444 --to 10.4.104.91:4444 --tcp
```
